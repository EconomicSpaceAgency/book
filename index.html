            Co-publishing is a new format for economic media that lets you take part in the publishing process. This book is divided into collectible paragraphs which visitors can individually choose to co-publish through a symbolic financial contribution. <br>
            <br>
            <i>At the beginning, all content is obscured. Through your participation, this text will gradually be made public, one unit at a time.</i> <br>

                This pricing slider is built on the principle of collective solidarity. Our hope is to make these units accessible to those in precarious situations or living in the global periphery. We trust that if you have benefited from systemic inequalities or the structures of capitalism, or if you reside and work in a country within the Imperial Core and possess the means, you'll consider adjusting the slider upwards.

            <sup>1</sup>Information has emerged dialectically as the most general form for the products of
            capitalism defined as having both use-value and exchange value. Because of its abstract character, it is
            often forgotten that information must have a material substrate, be it the standard commodity or an array of
            atoms on a computer chip. For the briefest of sketches, consider that the commodity was always composed of
            readable material differences, differences in matter created through labor. As a wager to get from M to M′,
            the commodity’s market legibility as a significant state of informed matter (a ‘hieroglyph’) has become
            increasingly computational. For my take on the networked commodity and the intimate connections between
            computing and capital see Beller (2017 and 2021). In each text I develop the argument that the general
            formula for capital can be rewritten M–I–M′, where M is money and I is information: Information replaces the
            commodity ‘C’ in Marx’s classic formulation M–C–M′.

            <sup>3</sup>Inspirational Marxist historian Eric Hobsbawm (1978) contended that the 1970s must be
            read as a crisis for working class organizations; a crisis from which they have not recovered. Our response
            is that collective endeavors that move beyond the control of capital must be focussed at the frontier of
            capitalist development&mdash;financial innovation&mdash;not in nostalgia for a resurgent industrial
            proletariat.

            terrorists, with sticks of illiquidity strapped to their chests, threatening to blow themselves up, and
            taking the rest of us with them, unless the state guaranteed market liquidity. And states gave those
            terrorists exactly what they wanted. The terrorist ransom payment is better known as Quantitative Easing,

            <sup>7</sup>From our perspective, bitcoin identified the trusted intermediary component of
            capitalism. That is, capitalism’s regime of verification depends on trust which, in its turn, ultimately
            depends on states’ monopoly on violence and coercion. Bitcoin expressed that there can be more dimensions of
            freedom. It opened the question of the sociality of value: it showed that value is always social,
            organizational and institutional. But bitcoin didn’t give a language to express it. The Economic Space
            Protocol is a grammar for expressing the sociality of value.

            <sup>63</sup>A parallel proposition in relation to capitalism is that competition for technical
            change (motivated by cost cutting, new product design, etc.) is of greater long-term significance than
            competition over prices in a market. Indeed, history shows that the great monopolies/oligopolies of history
            are defeated by being technologically superseded, not by competition from lower cost providers. We do not
            believe that data will somehow sit alongside price as an additional input to decision making, for within
            conventional calculus data will predictably be incorporated into pricing, and product design (and marketing)
            will become more differentiated in response to the patterned diversity revealed in data. We concur that the
            role of capitalist money will indeed be challenged. Yet the challenge will not be by recourse to an
            amorphous mass of statistics. It will occur via the invention of new, different indices: new modes of
            ‘money’ (tokens) expressing different social knowledges.

            <sup>73</sup>This is the first use of the term ‘commodity,’ which appears frequently in the
            following analysis. We define ‘commodities’ to include all outputs produced for, and recognized by, the
            network. It is not Marx’s use of the term, which associates commodities with capitalist production
            relations. There, commodity production has two dimensions: it is extractive, in the sense that commodities
            are produced by the workers and owned by the capitalist, and it is produced so as to be sold for a profit.
            This latter emphasis gives rise to the term ‘commodification,’ with more and more facets of social life
            converted into marketable opportunities for extraction. Our use of the term ‘commodity’ is more like Sraffa
            (1960) in his book <em>Production of Commodities by Means of Commodities</em>. There, commodities are all
            produced outputs. They are produced for a market, but they are not exchanged for money. This gives space for
            our proposition that commodities can be produced for the commons (without a price). Similarly, there can be
            no suggestion that our use of the term commodity is subject to a ‘fetishism’ of commodities, developed by
            Marx (1867) at the end Chapter&nbsp;1 of Volume I of <em>Capital</em>, for this term, too, is
            capitalist-specific. In many analyses, the political response to fetishism is to take goods and services out
            of market relations. Our proposal is to change the nature of markets.

            <sup>118</sup>The principle of standardized capitalist accounting first emerged in the 1850s,
            along with the legalization of joint stock companies (companies with shareholders) and limited liability.
            Investors needed standard performance metrics so that they could compare corporations and make informed
            investment choices and state protection against responsibility for the legal consequences of corporate
            actions. We know that these standard metrics, conventions and rules have been constantly evolving since
            then, but the connection of ledgers to profit has remained throughout. See, for example, Chiapello (2007),
            Levy (2014), Hopwood and Miller (1994) and Bryer (2000). Of course the proposition is not that everything in
            a capitalist society is expressed through profit criteria, but that this is the defining social feature of
            the era. Activities outside profit criteria are interpreted through the discourse of subsidies (and taxes),
            philanthropy or being classified simply as ‘non-economic.’

            the accounting dimension of the so-called ‘Cambridge Critique’ of capital theory which argues, in essence,
            that there is circularity in the conventional theory of capital: the value of capital cannot be specified
            until its rate of return is known and its rate of return cannot be known until capital is valued. See G.C

        <p><em>Protocols for Postcapitalist Expression</em>, written by ECSA (Economic Space Agency) thinkers Dick
            Bryan, Jorge López and Akseli Virtanen, marks an advance in the struggle for economic justice by directly
            addressing, and endeavoring to redress, the expropriation of the general intellect. The questions: Will the
            accumulated know-how of the species, alienated and, as Franco ‘Bifo’ Berardi (2012) put it, ‘looking for a
            body,’ lead to so-called humanity’s absolute demise (along with massive unrest and incalculable ecosystemic
            damage)? Or, is there emerging a path towards reparations, restoration, a just economy, and thus, a
            sustainable planetary society? It is as if the political slogan ‘No justice, no peace!’ now defines the
            spread of the possible futures for the global timeline.</p>

    <div id="u9" class="unit available">
        <p>Significantly, <em>Protocols for Postcapitalist Expression</em> does not give up on economic calculation or
            computing. It acknowledges that Economic Intelligence exists in historically sedimented economic categories
            and practices, but at the same time it recognizes that the form of knowledge that existing accounting
            creates simply cannot care about, and much less <em>for</em>, everyone. Composing a virtual computer,
            capitalist accounting processes allow for the judicious, that is profitable, apportioning of resources by
            producing a matrix of the fluctuating costs of production. Capital accumulation may be optimized by
            watching, in Hayek’s famous phrase, ‘the hands of a few dials.’ However, this calculus remains an imperial
            project beholden to the myriad violences of racial capitalism. In order to operationalize the world, the
            integration of money and computing reconstitutes the world as numbers, which is to say, as information.
            Arguably, we could even say, information is itself a derivative of the value-form.<sup class="footNote"
                id="fn1">1</sup> We might be forgiven for asking: does the collapse of values to exchange value, and
            more generally of qualities to number and thus to information have any liberatory potential whatsoever?</p>

        <p>Those who make it to the end of the TV series <em>Westworld</em> (Season 4), may discover where all this
            derivation and calculation may now be leading. Computing represents an arbitrage on intelligence that
            ultimately cheapens and thus discounts life. The show’s verisimilitude, what we could think of as its late
            capitalist realism, serves as a kind of trailer for, or preamble to, what would appear&mdash;<em>is
                appearing</em>&mdash;as a mutation in global consciousness and capacity, due to the financialization of
            knowledge. Because computing is inexorably entwined with existing markets and the statistical and predictive
            strategies necessary for the optimization of returns, computing, in the show at least, takes over
            species-being as it rapidly becomes the species-grave. The only ‘creature’ who will be left to remember
            whatever beauty, alternative values, grace and capacity for love that may have been expressed in the

            now, some parts or fractions of ‘us’ have thus far survived the rapacious calculus of profit, and are
            actively seeking ways to do things otherwise. At the very least, we know that some ‘we’ or some parts of
            ‘us’ must now intervene if further catastrophes are to be prevented. Through the lens of economics and
            financial calculus, <em>Protocols for Postcapitalist Expression</em> proposes a new form of economic
            intelligence and value-computing. The text proposes measures that do not collapse the qualitative concerns
            for well-being and being-with of those who currently are subjects of and subject to racial capitalism. ECSA
            has sought a way to allow for the expression and persistence of qualitative values on a computational
            substrate, an economic medium, such that these values are capable of (collectively) organizing economy. In
            theory, it becomes possible to avoid the collapse of people’s various pursuits into the value-form that is
            accumulated by capital and institutionalized through oppression, and to denominate quantities in terms of
            socially agreed upon qualities or qualifications, which is to say, values. Precluding the collapse of values
            by money and information opens a path to avoiding the collapse of space, time, and species existence by
            computational capitalism.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u13" class="unit available">
        <p>This proposed re-organization of value production and thus also of sociality requires a re-casting of what we
            today think of as the real or natural economic forms indexed under notions including ‘equity,’ ‘credit’ and
            (productive) ‘labor.’ Analytically in <em>Protocols,</em> these traditional terms have been decomposed,
            grasped as social arrangements and ‘network effects,’ and recomposed such that new conceptualizations and
            new types of actions and inflections&mdash;new socialities&mdash;become possible, while undervalued and
            marginalized traditional forms of sociality might thrive. Through this process of deconstruction and
            recomposition of actual and social computing, the text announces a possible socio-economic, computational
            strategy; a ‘play,’ for economics and for futurity, in what may well be the ‘one last dangerous game.’</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u14" class="unit available">
        <p>I say dangerous not only to refer to the current conditions on planet Earth, but because <em>Protocols</em>
            does accept aspects of the power of the value form and of economic calculus to organize societies at scale.
            Even as it recognizes the necessity for constellations of qualified local inputs that can persist on an
            economic substrate, it accepts the need for large scale organization, economic interoperability and
            network-specific units of account. It actually proposes that ‘economy’ needs to become more granular and
            more generalized. What needs to be altered is <em>what</em> the controls are, <em>who</em> has access to
            them, and the kind of literacy and feedback they require. While <em>Protocols</em> is a book of
            politico-economic analysis and insight, it should also be read as a script for the means to reappropriate
            the general intellect and thus use collective knowledge for the good of the social and ecological body.
            Surfaced from the unconscious operating systems of capital and reformatted, the protocols for constituting
            and holding equity become those for the distributed sharing of stake and thus for collectivizing risks and
            returns. The protocols for bank credit and monetary issuance become protocols for the peer-to-peer issuance
            of credit and for peer-to-peer credit clearing that is interoperable through a network of peers. The
            protocols for the organization of labor become protocols for the distributed assemblage of ‘performances.’
            Units of account become qualified measures and indices, devoted to the emergence of interoperable
            qualitative values. Economy moves from stranger-based to interpersonal to collective; the imperial
            organization of commodities by the accumulation of capital becomes the collection organization of sociality
            by all.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u15" class="unit available">
        <p>By shifting the architecture of economy and opening it as a design space, <em>Protocols</em> would enable, in
            principle, everyone to engage newly with and access differently what is, in effect, the historical
            objectifications of ‘human’ thought and practice endemic to capitalist infrastructure. But we could do so at
            a lower cost&mdash;to ourselves and to the lives of most of us!&mdash;and thereby, slowly, reclaim the
            wealth of our species capacities. Modifying accounting methods can create possibilities for the shedding of
            inequalities sedimented into capital. Users of the protocols, finding economic alternatives in one another,
            may refuse value extraction, get more of what we value for less, and be able to do so without exploiting
            others or being exploited. Altering the computing that backgrounds our sociality, <em>Protocols</em> would
            create zones of just and convivial social production (cooperatives, ephemeral and enduring) attuned to the
            values of like-minded co-creators cooperating in forms of mutual aid expressive of their shared values and
            concerns. The result of the use of qualitative values to account for and to organize economy at once
            produces and requires <em>a redesigned economic medium</em>, and <em>a new type of economic grammar</em>
            which utilizes different rules of composition, expression and accountability.</p>

    <div id="u16" class="unit available">
        <p>The text is the first complete edition of this new, if still rudimentary, economic grammar; it is a kind of
            manual for reprogramming the economic operating system. It is also a boot-strapping strategy to take back
            species abilities and creations that have been captured as assets (private property and monetary
            instruments). These assets include machinic fixed capital (platforms, code and clouds) as well as our own
            collateralized futures. The text, as an offer, is designed to open a spread between capitalist and
            postcapitalist futures. It would allow us to wager on the option that is justice (Meister).</p>

        <p>Whether as software, as clouds or as platforms, capital owns and rents back to us the accumulated products of

            Economic Space Protocol described by Bryan, Lopez and Virtanen, opens the possibility for creative
            capacities that are unalienated from their creators, that indeed produce a commonly-held set of capacities,
            a ‘synthetic commons,’ particularized and directed by the living concerns of those who create it. It holds

            spread on the social contract</h3>
        <p>Consider ‘social media’&mdash;what can be clearly seen as a world-changing extractive technology grafted onto
            the sociality it at once enables and overdetermines. It is no secret that the mega-media platforms and their
            hardware make money while they make us sick. In this 21st century recasting and expropriation of the general
            intellect, now giving rise to financialized AI, social media platforms absorb communication and
            consciousness along with all of our struggles for meaning, pleasure, connection, fulfillment and liberation.
            Their interfaces, algorithms and data-bases convert our all-too-human aspirations into private property and
            thus into capital. Thus, the expression of our struggles for happiness, knowledge and communion with one
            another produce an alienated and therefore alienating wealth for others. All those desires for liberation
            end up producing their antithesis: capital. By turning our meanings into accumulated data that function for
            capital as contingent claims on value that we will produce in the future, the economic logic of social media
            turns any and all politics expressed by means of its platforms, including the politics of solidarity, love
            and living otherwise, into a practical politics of hierarchy and capitalist extraction. By converting all of
            our semiotic signals into financialized information, and thus into profits, ‘social’ media stripmines our
            libido, our consciousness, our imagination. In doing so, all the points of meaning and affect distributed
            across the socius and absorbed in one way or another by computing can thereby be grasped for performing
            social and organizational functions in a matrix of financialized information. This information in its
            architecture and management&mdash;<em>its organizational protocols</em>&mdash;transfers value up the stack,
            only to devalue the increasingly abject denizens of planet Earth. In the current world operating system, for
            which social media forms only one, albeit <em>paradigmatic</em>, layer of calculation, the meanings we
            create and the emotions we experience, however real and ‘immediate’ they may be, are interfaces with
            computing; they are productive interfaces with racial capitalism. As we perform, in the very expression of
            our quests for life, what elsewhere I have called ‘informatic labor,’ we experience first hand the
            alienation of our performative powers in the actually existing economic media of racial capitalism, that is,
            computational racial capitalism.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u19" class="unit available">
        <p>It is in this context of the latest stage of capitalism that something really interesting can finally be said
            about the rise of blockchain and cryptocurrency. This cryptographic medium, which has the network
            architecture of a messaging system, is a medium in the strong sense, akin, as I have elsewhere remarked, to
            photography in the mid-1800s or cinema in the early 1900s. Without turning any of the apparent key players
            here&mdash;the Satoshis and Vitaliks&mdash;into heroes, we might see in the ‘mankind sets forth only such
            problems as he can solve [sic.]’ scenario of history, a significant emergence in response to a collective
            demand. This emergence answers the call for a new form of <em>economic media</em> in order to express an
            alternate vision of the world. That expression, at first apparently as a monetary medium, begins to overturn
            the seemingly stable notions of asset, money, credit, labor, capital, derivative and many other ‘known’
            financial entities implicit in, and indeed part of, the protocols of existing monetary media. The
            alternative vision is a programmable substrate that opens computational media to the possibility of a
            (re-)programming of the economic layer of computing by non-state and non-corporate actors. If we want to put
            a point on it, the great disruption underfoot is that <em>economy becomes programmable from below</em>.
            That, in itself, is a change in the semantics, as well as the capacities, of economy. When we recognize that
            our communications media are overdetermined in their function by existing monetary media, to the extent that
            they serve as an extension of its profit seeking logics, we begin to see that our communications media are
            already economic media, even though their capabilities seemed to have developed in separate and even
            autonomous domains.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u20" class="unit available">
        <p>The internet promised to democratize expression by enabling publishing and indeed broadcasting from below;
            but nothing about the internet changed the basic economic architecture of capitalist extraction. Indeed, in
            decentralizing communications, the internet extended and granularized the centralizing logics and logistics
            of capitalism, pushing them deeper into expressivity, thought and affect. It captures mass expressivity and
            converts it into capital. This colonization of the imaginary and symbolic registers results in a
            financialized cybernetics of mind. For democratization to happen in a meaningful way, the systems of
            accounts inherent in many-to-many distributed media, be they networked monetary systems (USD) or
            communications (Facebook), must become programmable from below. For this to happen, platforms and computing
            must be made programmable from below. The cybernetics of economic media must be deleveraged from capital
            accumulation. This transformation, and how it may be achieved, is indicated in <em>Protocols</em>.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u21" class="unit available">
        <p>Why do the cybernetics of sociality matter? For our futurity and indeed for our survival, we require an
            alternative to monological systems of value as expressed in national monies. We require, in short, a
            <em>multi-dimensional</em> modality of valuation not bound by the econometrics and informatic collapse
            inherent in capital. Multidimensional valuation implies the creation of eco-social relations that can
            dialogically express and preserve discourse-based values on an economic substrate, while being programmable
            in real time by any and all participants. (Before anyone up and leaves at the sudden thought of having to
            wake up and program, think first of an interface like <em>Instagram</em> with a tunable economic logic built
            in. Think also of how these already-familiar technologies of social mediation change our experiences and
            actualities of relation and ‘reality.’) We require the power to qualify value and to allow such
            qualification to both persist in an economic system and be computable. Ultimately, we will require that this
            system itself be collectively owned; that it be a commons.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u22" class="unit available">
        <p>Robust economic media, capable of heteroglossic and dialogical forms of account, are required to create a
            multiperspectival values-system. These media demand far more than merely a non-national variant of monetary
            media expressive of the capitalist value form. While the non-national dimension of cryptocurrencies
            introduced a significant rupture with conventional monetary substrates, platformed as they are as national
            currencies on nation states, their legally recognized institutions and their military police, this
            ultimately simple replatforming of singular denominations on distributed computing by existing
            cryptocurrencies is not enough. Bitcoin did in fact break the nationally managed monopolies on 21st century
            monetary issuance by introducing a scalable currency(/asset/option) platformed on distributed computing, but
            it has done, and can do, little or nothing to challenge the monologic denomination of value as a
            one-dimensional, that is as a unitary, currency format. Bitcoin may contest the nation, but it, and its
            fetishism, is all about it being an option on the value-form as historically worked up under, and as,
            capitalism. The question ‘Bitcoin or USD’ scarcely touches the relations of production. We must see clearly
            that the ‘disintermediation’ of ‘trusted third parties’ and of existing states, even if it were to be
            accomplished, is only one part of the picture of a liberated monetary medium, which is also to say, a
            liberated socius. We require the possibility for <em>anyone</em> to offer denominations of value that can be
            taken up by those who share such values as specified and indeed offered in the proffered denomination. Only
            then will we have a genuinely multiperspectival system.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u23" class="unit available">
        <p>To foreground this possibility of reprogramming a global operating system, one that is at once computational
            and financial, stakes a claim for a different order of significance for cryptomedia. Even Ethereum, and
            other ‘Layer 1’ projects that utilize smart contracts and allow for further token issuance, lack a robust
            grammar for composable asset creation and peer-to-peer issuance; a grammar that would allow for the on-chain
            preservation of qualities and the spontaneous creation of denominations. Outlining the emergence of a far
            more robust economic medium than what is currently wet dreamt by the ‘when Lambo?’ crypto bros going on
            about libertarian forms of self-sovereignty, <em>Protocols</em> posits a transformation not just of economy
            but of sociality, of subjectivity, of national politics and of ecopolitics by means of the composition and
            recomposition of relations of production. For those actively working in the ECSA project, what unites us as
            current contributors, even among our many differences, is that the radical development of economic media
            means that the intelligence of sociality, including that which has not been subsumed, can work for the
            socius, rather than be captured, farmed, privatized and put back on the market in an arbitrage on knowledge,
            where proprietary innovation captures the returns.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u24" class="unit available">
        <p>As <em>Protocols</em> explains, robust economic media mean that, through the equitable nomination of new
            asset classes and the collective denomination of values (practices which will require networked recognition,
            participation and validation), innovation can be collectively shared rather than capitalized. The text
            argues that through the sharing of stake, wealth, whose actual origins are inexorably social, can be
            socialized. We might add that <em>Protocols</em> intimates that society might ultimately be decolonized
            because it would, after a time, no longer be organized from the imperial standpoint of Value. The deep
            plurality of being, though suppressed in commodity reification and egoism alike, but in fact constituting
            each and all, might at last be felt and actualized. It means, in short, that the other person might at last
            become not a limit to your freedom, but the realization of it.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u25" class="unit available">
        <p>Note that no other major crypto project addresses the world in these terms. Nor do they think very deeply, if
            at all, about the adjoined problem of sovereignty <em>and</em> subjectivity, or the cybernetics thereof. It
            has become clearer to the participants in the ECSA project that the form many recognize as the sovereign
            individual is but an iteration of the value form, an avatar of capital.<sup class="footNote"
                id="fn2">2</sup> But given these economic and formal overdeterminations of agency and the reign of this
            type of sovereignty, we see that history, or at least collective survival, demands better chances. We have
            had enough of egomania and nationalism. The significance of things on the ground must be registered and
            economically expressed. To those ends, <em>Protocols for Postcapitalist Expression</em> is in pursuit of
            something of a different order; something that must <em>risk</em> the increasing granularization and
            resolution of computing and of the economy that computing has always expressed. <em>Protocols</em> must risk
            this granularization and resolution <em>because that is what is already happening.</em> But collective
            survival necessitates something that also simultaneously enables a <em>detournement</em> of extant economic
            logics and practices. ECSA’s analysis recognizes that the concentration of agency, whether in the form of
            the propertied individual or of the propertied immortal individuals called corporations and states, requires
            the collapse of the concerns of others, of their perspectives and of their information. It is precisely the
            refusal of that collapse that motivates the work presented in <em>Protocols</em>.</p>

            we are ready for an economic and computational grammar that is answerable in new ways. That also means
            programmable in new ways, where programming by the many becomes both the way to answer economic precarity
            and the means to posit and preserve a plurality of qualitative values. We will answer economy with economy!
            The leveraged monologue of national monies, the leveraged computing architectures of privately-owned
            platforms, the near monopoly on who can issue what kinds of monies and types of financial instruments,
            including derivatives, must, if the people and ecosystems of Earth are to thrive, be delimited and, in their
            current forms, swept away. All of these media, we now perceive, are not only financial forms, but also
            informatic forms: programs in every sense of the word. They are integrated, interoperating systems, and are
            systems of account beholden, ultimately, to little other than profit in nationally-denominated monies;
            monies, we can remind ourselves, that are optimized by states and supported by their historical,
            institutionalized forms of organizational inequality, prisons and warlike foreign policy.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u27" class="unit available">
        <p>ECSA understands these systems of account, whether conceived of as interfaces, databases, financial
            instruments and ledgers, or as forms of money or money as capital, to be <em>semantic forms</em>; forms that
            have meaning and thus compatibility and commensurability with one another, but also, and as importantly,
            forms that put exorbitant pressure on life and <em>its</em> meanings. Today’s socio-economic systems
            threaten insolvency, war and extinction. They threaten all forms of meaning-making that are close to the
            flesh and close to the earth: desire, the imagination, consciousness, speech, writing, landscape, oceans,
            the body, the self. They pressure meaning, living and life, and can do so because money is composed of a set
            of contracts; contracts that, in effect, have subsumed, and then become, the social contract. That
            subsumption of the social contract by the protocols of the media of racial capitalism is the ultimate
            meaning of ‘the dissolution of traditional societies.’ The ECSA project, to create non-extractive,
            disalienating, just economy and sociality, is given new impetus with this volume and the promise it holds. A
            recasting of the current social contract has long been dreamt. At last, perhaps, we have an option on
            postcapitalism; one that, by reimagining the who and the how in the creation of contracts, will allow us to
            open and live in the spread between two basic futures: collectivism or extinction.</p>

        <p>The book in your hands or on your screen would be a new beginning. It represents not a settling of accounts
            but a new mode of accounting and of being accountable to one another. A revaluation of values becomes
            possible by means of what is here called an ‘economic grammar,’ a grammar for the assemblage of new
            relations of production and thus new modes of production, and new forms of (collective) relation and
            self-governance. The core idea is to express values differently, such that the qualitative concerns of any
            and potentially all members of society may be expressed at once semantically and economically on a
            persistent and programmable substrate. These values may be assembled by many parties and then used to
            coordinate performances in accord with socially agreed upon and thus collectively mandated metrics.
            ‘Agreement’ here is a semantic and an economic term that, though formally accurate, is not quite adequate to
            affectively express the character and indeed the <em>feel</em> of social co-creation ECSA sees as becoming

        <p>As a starting point among starting points, this text comes out of years of research at ECSA and offers the
            most comprehensive treatment and latest refinements of a set of protocols based on an analysis of finance,
            monetary networks, and the extractive processes of postmodern value production. A critique of this latter,
            namely the capture of semiotic and other forms of social performances by ambient computing, has enabled ECSA
            to endeavor to liberate social performances from such capture. ‘Performance’ in this text has emerged,
            dialectically as it were, as the most general act of production; what is extracted on the job, at work, on
            social media, in maker-spaces and in the arts. Always dialogical, performance can be taken as a category of
            social interaction and world-creation that names the emergent superset for other productive capacities
            designated by terms including labor, attention, attention economy, cognition, cognitive capitalism and
            virtuosity.</p>

    <div id="u31" class="unit available">
        <p>Counter-intuitively perhaps, the strategy includes the generalization of the power to issue&mdash;to issue
            financial instruments that not only fund co-creation, but create possibilities for speculation and
            arbitrage. A capacity to express, issue, and wager on shared futures shifts the economic ground,
            particularly for the smallest players who currently have no access to scripting economic protocols with
            which a shared future might be wagered. Can we create with and for one another’s todays and tomorrows in
            ways that cause less suffering and are more convivial than they could be were we to attempt to do it in the
            capitalist markets? Can we use our powers of co-creation to siphon value out of the capitalist system in
            order to build a collectivist postcapitalism? To be dramatic, part of the political answer to the obscene
            leverage of class power and national power on the masses, is to generalize, which is to say democratize, the
            power to write (co-author) derivative contracts (co-author since in these protocols, all issuance is
            bilateral). It is time that the masses leveraged our claims, by creating our own economic networks with a
            new grammar and co-created, optional rules of play. This power, made possible by platforming protocols for
            cooperation around values creation, allows for an extended practice of community as well as the elaboration
            of what Randy Martin (2013a, 2015; Lee and Martin 2016) called ‘social derivatives.’ The social derivative
            is a cultural instrument that is wagered in social spaces already shot through with financial volatility. It
            allows marginalized groups, in Martin’s words, to ‘risk together to get more of what we want.’ It is in this
            way that the logic contained in <em>Protocols</em>, that allows for the mass authorship of social
            derivatives, may well succeed in democratization where the internet failed.</p>

        <p>While this power for anyone to write a derivative may sound esoteric (or even impossible and/or
            undesirable)&mdash;and part of the book that follows this foreword <em>is</em> somewhat esoteric&mdash;a
            breaking down the barriers to the publishing of derivative instruments means that, in a world already
            rendered precarious by the history of racial capitalism, everyone (not just elites) may be better able to
            manage their undeniable risk by organizing their economy, cooperatively and collectively, and in terms of
            what is valuable to them. If neoliberalism taught us anything, it is that the way out of the problems of
            capitalism cannot, and will never, be through the creation of more capitalism. That is why we have
            reimagined the cryptotoken as a set of programmable capabilities (agreements) that may be enabled only when
            recognized and thereby validated by peers. Their semantic content represents a wager that the relationship,
            or agreement, they formalize expresses something of value (anything whatever) to both parties. Because each
            party or agent is enabled in the network through composing themselves&mdash;by entering into a portfolio of
            such tokenized arrangements that are in principle limitless&mdash;the wealth of each agent then becomes a
            composite of the qualified interests of others.</p>

    <div id="u34" class="unit available">
        <p>A social derivative is a wager in the cultural sphere that responds to volatility in order that a local group
            can ‘risk together.’ <em>Protocols</em> has tried to formalize a way to express those socio-economic wagers,
            such that others can validate or join them non-extractively by means of their own staking and/or
            performance. It becomes possible, at first in principle but later practically, to nominate and denominate
            values and then to collectively organize socio-economic outcomes of any type that preserve, foster and
            realize said values: differentiable, negotiable and socially agreed upon qualitative values. This is
            economic expressivity. When many actors are offering such semio-economic proposals and performances on a
            collectively-owned economic media platform, socio-economic actors such as ourselves may engage in a
            multidimensional system of valuation and production attuned to anything whatever: clean beaches, dance
            cultures, reforestation, spoken word, prison abolition, decolonial resurgence, blood free computing, and
            much more. When we have a way of sharing risk, both by sharing stake (staking a performance) and/or offering
            performance, in a variety of qualitative outcomes by means of a scalable peer-to-peer network, we get forms
            of distributed risk and reward that can create a distributed form of awareness&mdash;a consciousness attuned
            to the specific interests of many others. This awareness results from, and constitutes, a new form of
            economic space and new form of economic agency: economic space agency. It will also transform
            subjectivity/objectivity and the membrane between self and other.</p>

        <p>Though this new economic language may sound like it requires a learning curve too steep for the ‘average’
            person, the literacy and innovation will come, just as it did and does on paradigm shifting platforms such
            as Facebook, Instagram and TikTok. Here, the emerging paradigm comes with the social programmability
            inherent in expressivity directly linked to the programmability of economy. The postcapitalist economy will
            be about creating new forms of social relations; new relations of production that are qualitative and
            non-extractive. Collectively, we will script parameters that express our semantically based, qualitative
            values, and collectively we will manifest these values. We may hope, and perhaps expect, that within a few
            years or decades, folks will not be programming their fractal celebrity; they will be programming together
            the nuanced worlds they actually want to live in and creating the relationships they want to have there.</p>

        <p>There is much to learn, and much to be skeptical of. To answer the global challenges set forth by history
            will require the input and discernment of millions if not billions of people&mdash;it is not a technocratic
            endeavor. Already there are millions among us who feel the need for alternative economic forms and for a
            type of radical economy and/or finance that answers onthe-ground problems of access to liquidity. The
            movement towards basic income is just one expression of this desire. In <em>Protocols</em> what becomes
            possible is <em>basic equity</em> founded upon ones’ social relations. Our requirement for emancipation is
            not further dispossession of others or ourselves but expanded access to the social product, particularly for
            those who do not have it. We agree with the growing mass need for our desires and our capacities to count

            deforestation, police killings, settler colonialism and genocide to make the point here. But this book,
            though still incomplete in significant ways and offering more of a possible way forward than any as yet
            definitive answer, offers what approaches a concrete plan; one that may move readers from increased
            eco-social literacy to active participation in building an alternative economy. It would organize social
            participation that will create greater literacy and expressivity even as it endeavors to collectively create
            and thus instantiate, a new economic medium&mdash;an economic medium for the expression and collective
            management of a postcapitalist economy; a medium that is socially and ecologically responsive, which is to
            say, increasingly non-extractive because its interfaces are made to be just. The entire project stands or
            falls on this wager. However, that said, the book is but a seed, one that only collective uptake, and with
            it collective revision, can nurture and grow.</p>

        <p>Lastly, the desire for non-, ante-, anti- and/or post-capitalism is in no way an invention of this text; what
            feels new here is the method. I would say that it proposes a new way to mobilize what Harney and Moten
            (2013) call the general antagonism, and with it, a new form of revolution. What would it be? A
            <em>detournement</em> of financial processes and tools, a slow takeover of the economic operating system
            occupying planet earth by those whose interests have been collapsed into bank interest. Indeed, it is the
            <em>incapacity</em> to do just this granular and collective reformatting of the economy that has marked the
            failure of previous revolutions. Thus far, beyond the initial desperation, beauty and romanticism of
            revolutionary movements, we have mostly had various efforts at a seizing of the state that result in the
            reintroduction and replication of the gendered, racial and hierarchical logics of capitalism. From the
            Soviets, to the PRC, to scores of post-colonial states, we are familiar with the outcomes. The limitations
            were both of imagination and technology; movements weighed down by default notions of centralization and
            bureaucratic organization, notions that informed both emergent states and the discrete state computing that
            would develop to run them and all the others. This time, with another century of struggle and know-how, if
            we all listen to history and to the claims of the denizens of Earth, things may be different.</p>

        <p>The ECSA project opens a spread on racial capitalism and endeavors to use its historically consolidated
            capacities (<em>our</em> capacities), including the power of financial instruments and computing, to wager
            on postcapitalist outcomes. Contrary to racial capitalism, the arbitrage on intelligence proposed here is to
            reduce the cost to the planet for collective re-imagination and re-organization, while also collectivizing
            the returns on the benefits of creating more convivial forms of life. We will reduce the price of survival,
            in terms of violence to others, in terms of the individual requirements for the value-form (money), and in
            absolute terms. Perhaps we will collectivize values creation and distribution/sharing to the point of
            overcoming the value form of capital itself. In any case, by utilizing the accumulated knowledge implicit in
            financial instruments and computing derived from, but not beholden to, capitalism, we will be creating a
            grammar for postcapitalist economic expression. The ECSA vision might just open an option on postcapitalist
            futures. This option would be one where we can risk together for non-capitalist outcomes, and do so from
            within capital. As Jodi Melamed (2015:82) says:</p>

            <p>Marx finds value itself to be a pharmekon: it is a poison because it is a measure of how much human labor

                grasp individual human efforts as alienated social forces, which revolutionary struggles can turn toward

        <div id="u43" class="unit available">
            <p>Despite a deepening climate disaster, consecutive global economic crises and a socially devastating pandemic,
                the last two decades have found us living in an era of capitalist triumphalism. In almost all capitalist
                countries, political leaders celebrate their achievements in promoting economic growth and stock market
                record highs while ‘successfully managing’ wage growth. State ‘reforms’ of all kinds have seen growing
                precarity of those whose living standard is low and growing wealth and security for those at the top. Indeed
                increasing inequality seems to be the current engine of economic growth and it is only in the very recent
                past that concerns for the biosphere have looked like a constraint on that momentum. At an individual level,
                it is now clear to many people that the economic aspirations of a previous generation are no longer
                available to the majority of the population, and especially younger people. The combination of education,
                finding permanent employment, and saving diligently in a bank or pension fund is no longer a formula for
                life security&mdash;it’s not available and increasingly it’s not aspired to. Education is now about debt
                accumulation with no guarantee it will generate the capacity for repayment; permanent employment and the
                idea of a predictable, secure income is, for a growing proportion of the working population, both
                unavailable and oppressive, and saving in banks sees negative real returns while wage payments into pension
                funds constrain current living standards in the name of a self-reliant old age.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="u44" class="unit available">
            <p>The starkest challenges to capitalist triumphalism have not come from what we would call the traditional
                ‘left’: the trades union or the socialist organizations. Predominantly, they have been in defensive mode,
                trying to hold back change. The emerging challenge is from a different source: people who simply don’t want
                to play by the rules of capitalist economics; who want to define themselves outside its discipline and its
                system or rewards.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="u45" class="unit available">
            <p>Generally, these people aren’t in trades union or political parties; they may not see themselves as being on
                the ‘left.’ So how do we profile these people? Perhaps they are open source developers, but their designs
                can’t be easily monetized, or won’t be funded by the internet monopolies. They may well create social
                benefits, but their innovation doesn’t comply with corporate business plans. Perhaps they see themselves as
                a custodian of the commons, but can’t see a way to expand the organization of that role to the scale
                required. Or maybe they care passionately about environmental decay and work to build biosustainability. But
                they know that, for all the official posturing about sustainability and concessions to green industry, the
                current system will never pursue deep changes that will save the planet, because returns to investors will
                always shout loudest in any debate. They might work in various forms of human care, for low or even zero
                income, and generally without much social recognition, but they know their contribution is socially
                essential and should be rewarded with a reasonable income. Or perhaps they work in art and design, and hear
                governments pronounce on the importance of cultural creation, but see them deliver miniscule funding to
                people who are indeed performing critical social roles.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="u46" class="unit available">
            <p>What all these endeavors have in common is that they generate social benefits but aren’t recognized as
                profitable in a capitalist sense; indeed as not creating a surplus, to use a more general term. In a
                Covid-dominated world, with state fiscal austerity and protracted economic downturn awaiting, their
                financial future is bleak. Will audiences return with spending power; will governments still give grants;
                will philanthropists feel as generous?</p>
        </div>
        <div id="u47" class="unit available">
            <p>An alternative for these sorts of people could be to participate in an economy that values differently: both
                in the sense of different modes of calculating economic ‘value’ and with different collective social and
                ethical values. This would be an economy not driven specifically by profitability, nor reliant on state
                subsidies or philanthropy, but one which draws on aspirations and affects, to value social, creative and
                environmental benefits, without reducing all contributions into a price. Artists and designers, along with
                people performing care roles&mdash;care for people or for the environment&mdash;could be rewarded for what
                they actually contribute to society.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="u48" class="unit available">
            <p>This is the economy that we are aspiring to see built. We are pitching our network design particularly to the
                generation of people who want to do it differently: who know from personal experience that the conventional
                economic system is not serving them well individually or collectively, and are looking for ways to
                participate in building a collective future of their shared design.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="u49" class="unit available">
            <p>Our proposal is that analysis must start at the frontier of current change, and work out how to subvert its
                momentum. A critical factor in framing this direction is the recognition that social and economic power has
                shifted dramatically since the 1970s from industrial capital, and the workplace-based unions who battled it,
                to finance, where there is little organized resistance; at least not the old kind of resistance. Finance is
                too elusive, too liquid and mobile to be trapped in power battles with organized labor, and the people
                employed by finance are not generally in a union-based labor force.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="u50" class="unit available">
            <p>Economically and politically, if we want to build postcapitalism, we must start by recognising this power of
                finance and challenge it by building a different finance. The ultimate goal is an economy of production,
                animated by alternative social and ethical values, and the starting point is finance.<sup class="footNote"

        </div>
        <div id="u51" class="unit available">
            <p>Finance is both dynamic and fragile. In its current dominant form, it goes to where the profits are greatest,
                but it instantly retreats when the profits are not appearing. So it is a direct discipline on those who need
                finance: they must deliver profits, or they suffocate.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="u52" class="unit available">
            <p>But its liquidity and mobility is also its vulnerability, for finance depends critically on the state to
                provide it with a money instrument and to underwrite its social reputation and its profit. The US-initiated
                subprime crisis of 2007–2008 and, even more emphatically, the 2020s Covid pandemic have revealed how the
                fast and free movement of finance can undermine its own conditions of existence. In both periods we have
                seen nation states (predominantly through their central banks) having to throw money at financial markets to
                secure liquidity and sustain financial market profits. In 2008, the US Federal Reserve Chairman argued
                behind closed doors that the state has to do whatever it takes to preserve financial market profits or
                economic disaster would follow.<sup class="footNote" id="fn4">4</sup> By 2020, the financial institutions
                were themselves confidently asserting the demand for the state to guarantee their profitability.<sup

        <div id="u53" class="unit available">
            <p>Somehow, we have collectively fallen into the position where these institutions hold the key to our
                viability. The oppression of the treadmill of working for wages and the intrusion of the logic of finance
                into daily life now express both the triumph of capitalism and the reason so many people are resisting its
                consequences.</p>

        <div id="u54" class="unit available">
            <p>But if the current era is about the shift from the power of industrial capital to the power of financial
                capital, then the new, emerging forms of opposition need to be uniting around finance. Some have been tried,
                but ultimately they succumb to the power of what they oppose. In 2011 <em>Occupy Wall Street</em> was the
                initial instantiation of this opposition in its contemporary form, but it was conceived as a protest and a
                spatial obstacle in the movement of financial actors; not an alternative finance. <em>Occupy</em> could be
                dispersed by the state power of the police. In 2021, social media mobilized a crash of hedge funds
                short-selling GameStop (GME) shares, and with short-term success, but ultimately at significant cost to
                participants. Neither was sustainable.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="u55" class="unit available">
            <p>The idea that there could be a different finance, or that certain monetary roles could be performed outside
                the current financial system and without state backing, had already emerged in 2008, but not initially in a
                recognizable form. That new possibility came into being with Satoshi Nakomoto’s <em>Bitcoin White Paper</em>
                (2008). Its implications have become worrying for states and big financial institutions alike, for it usurps
                their power to determine the rules of finance and how the economy should operate.</p>

            <p>This is where the domain of cryptographically enabled decentralized economic-organizational systems (a.k.a

                industrial-based organizations of the left now cannot and probably never could: it challenges the state’s

            <p>That’s still not how most people are thinking of crypto, although attitudes are changing rapidly. One
                widespread image, especially from those invested in the current financial status quo, is of cryptotokens as
                scams and crypto markets as casinos of speculative bets. An alternative image is of a libertarian
                anti-statism of freely associating individuals, pursuing their own goals in the name of some individualistic
                conception of ‘freedom.’ Both of these views warrant direct critique, and these will be developed in
                subsequent chapters. It will be revealed that they may not be ‘wrong,’ for there is evidence of all these
                characteristics, but the critiques are trivial and dangerous in equal measure. They are trivial because
                crypto token design keeps evolving and markets in aggregate seem resistant to the effects of scams and
                volatility (though some individuals certainly lose wealth). Continual predictions of the pending demise of
                the cryptocurrency markets are consistently wrong. The critiques are dangerous because they are premised on
                the idea that, with sufficient diatribe, crypto currencies and the technology they represent will simply
                disappear. So they encourage the perspective of crypto as a cult, and thereby discourage the importance of a
                wider population inquiring into the potential for new ways of thinking with cryptographically enabled
                technologies.</p>

            <p>Beneath these ideologically-defined polemics, ‘crypto’ simply offers various versions of a technology of
                communication and exchange: the possibility of coordinating chains of interactions without a central 3rd
                party authority. And basically that’s all it can do. Economic protocol design must be much more, but
                critically built on that game-changing technology. So our project is to push past this ideological polemic
                and immediately frame crypto technological innovation as a site of social contestation about the sorts of
                social interactions we are seeking to facilitate, built on top of a technology of communication and
                exchange.</p>

    </div>
    <div id="u63" class="unit available">
        <p>Blockchain-based innovations for economic and financial design are evolving rapidly. Most recently, DAOs,
            DeFi, stablecoins, DEXs, liquidity farming, NTF markets and creator and community tokens offer expansive new
            possibilities. But what will be the next frontier; the next big development?</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u64" class="unit available">
        <p>What does history suggest?</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u65" class="unit available">
        <p>By today’s standards, history moved in slow motion. It records that money, roughly as we now know it, dates
            from about the 7th century BCE. Recognizably modern banking developed in the Northern Italian coastal cities
            of Florence, Venice and Genoa in the 14th century, driven by the funding requirements of long-distance
            trade. This banking evolved over the next few centuries from funding commerce to funding the rise of
            industrial production, and a system we call capitalism. The formation of joint stock companies and a liquid
            stock exchange in the mid 19th century transformed ownership of capital to decentralized protocols, though
            the division between ownership and management served to re-centralize the control. This is the corporate
            capitalism we know today.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u66" class="unit available">
        <p>In cryptohistory, that long evolution looks like it is happening over little more than a decade. Bitcoin as a
            new, distinctive p2p form of money arrived in 2009, with DeFi (decentralized finance, or banking protocols)
            becoming prevalent a decade later; funding new kinds of distributed exchange and money games. Governance
            mechanisms of DAOs and in-house treasury functions, broadly replicating the roles of the corporate form,
            followed immediately afterwards. History would say that these developments must surely evolve to the funding
            of a new era of production as its next logical step. But that next step is yet to emerge, and its possible
            shape is still unclear.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u67" class="unit available">
        <p>It is already clear this future will be ‘post-industrial,’ with information at the center, as both its
            predominant input and output. But what will be its social shape; what technical capacities and social
            relations will it build upon? There are two complementary, contemporary developments that are critical:
            distributed money and the iteration of the internet that brings decentralization back into its heart; also
            known as Web3 or the Economic Web.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u68" class="unit available">
        <p>First, distributed money. The development of blockchain technology opened the possibility of re-thinking
            money: what it is, who issues it and who controls its value. Bitcoin initiated a new form of money, but it
            remains centrally issued and controlled by the global virtual agent that maintains the ledger in singular
            blockchain. Network protocol design creates the possibility for a <em>distributed</em> money system where
            there is no central money issuer. All agents can be issuers, while network-recognized collateral for such
            lending means the money system can nonetheless remain stable. These are already the foundations of current
            shadow banking. Such a money system is elaborated below.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u69" class="unit available">
        <p>Distributed ‘money’ can then be put at the service of pursuing postcapitalist economic values (modes of
            calculating), effectively superseding the profit-based calculus that is embedded in the price of and access
            to conventional money. In relation to capitalism, we can now have a parallel (but interacting) money system,
            associated with a parallel (but interacting) value system.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u70" class="unit available">
        <p>Second, Web3. We have designed an economy that draws on the data and network capacities that were driving the
            initial development of the internet more than forty years ago: <em>an internet native economic system.</em>
            We have built on the vision of Web3 and the re-imagined potential in the internet: its capacity for trust
            and verifiability, for scalability and decentralized relations, with users owning and in charge of their own
            data. The potential of Web3 opens a new economic imaginary, where peer-to-peer economic networking protocols
            can create performances and outputs out of information creation and exchange, distributed computation,
            connectivity and network relationships. Codified incentives and enforcement can motivate new economic
            relations, with informational value transmitted as tokens. There is a lot to absorb in these last sentences,
            and the process tagged here will be elaborated in the chapters below.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u71" class="unit available">
        <p>We see Web3 engaging the native potential of the internet, challenging and going beyond the power of the
            current major internet players (tech companies, financial institutions and other collectors and users of
            consumer data) who have channeled, and even prevented, the realization of this potential by means of
            copyright, paywalls, advertising, data extraction, etc. so that internet expansion remains consistent with
            tech company profitability.<sup class="footNote" id="fn6">6</sup> A blockchain-based distributed money
            doesn’t need to ‘take on’ these corporate giants; it is sufficient simply to sidestep them.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u72" class="unit available">
        <p>Web3 offers the potential for what we call ‘economic media’ for expressing economic-organizational
            relationships and networks. The capacities of distributed economic communication have yet to emerge.
            Bitcoin, for all its innovation, preserves fiat money’s monologic monetary value (‘price’), not the broad
            sweep of social meaning that can attach to exchange.<sup class="footNote" id="fn7">7</sup> Other crypto
            designs (such as Ethereum) have attempted through smart contracts to make this expression on the blockchain
            more robust by creating programmable money, but the full development of a cohesive and expressive,
            decentralized medium of value networks has not yet been achieved. We are building on this aspiration.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u73" class="unit available">
        <p>When we turn to finance, we see the same processes that were just depicted in relation to the internet.
            Credit, which is essentially a system of IOUs, requires systemic trust, scale and collateral. The current
            world of institutional banking and finance performs these and other functions in a way that extracts wealth
            from, and imposes surveillance on, those who borrow and lend. Decentralized Finance (DeFi), like Web3, is
            offering the alternative to this corporate control by developing decentralized credit issuance and other
            financial products of risk management. But can DeFi develop the extra stage and link to the funding of
            investment in new systems of production? We believe that this requires an analytical leap: to think of stake
            (ownership of investment) as the preferred collateral for reciprocal issuance of credit.<sup
                class="footNote" id="fn8">8</sup> It will give credit a material and expandable foundation. Financing
            investment in new forms of production (performances) will itself open up new possibilities for DeFi that
            link to the ‘real’ economy.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u74" class="unit available">
        <p>For us, the goal of realizing the potential of Web3 for economic design, extending DeFi into investing and
            staking, and building an economic space of many collective values are all parts of the same vision. These
            connections are our depiction of collaborative finance (CoFi),<sup class="footNote" id="fn9">9</sup> and the
            proposition that it is through finance that a network most actively coheres. But, in connection to our
            starting question of what the future holds, we need a clear stepping off point. In capitalism, it is the
            state that economically ties the present to the future<sup class="footNote" id="fn10">10</sup>. It issues
            treasury bonds and oversees the yield curve, it sets the base interest rates from which commercial rates
            follow and it manipulates exchange rates, etc.. But in a new economy, it can be the protocol designs of
            distributed finance that economically links the present to the future.<sup class="footNote"
                id="fn11">11</sup> So it is critical that the interaction of credit, investment and exchange&mdash;all
            dimensions of CoFi&mdash;are integral to protocol design.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u75" class="unit available">
        <p>The subsequent chapters of this analysis work systematically through these issues, moving from the creation
            of new products (Chapter&nbsp;4) to staking their creation and distributing their outputs (Chapter&nbsp;5),
            to a system of credit that keeps the system of performances and distribution flowing (liquid)
            (Chapter&nbsp;8).</p>

        <h5>1.3 A new economic space; new economic performances</h5>
    </div>
    <div id="u77" class="unit available">
        <p>To conceive of a viable postcapitalism that gives focus to collective, shared futures, we start from the
            proposition that the economy is a network: a group of agents interacting under certain agreements,
            (i.e. protocols) which define the relations that form the network, and how its state may change.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u78" class="unit available">
        <p>Protocols involve design choices and they can embed the capacity to be redesigned at the will of the network
            itself. A postcapitalism must be built ‘inside’ capitalism and find its own way to emerge ‘out of’
            capitalism. Our approach combines the radical rupture of bitcoin with the integration of CoFi and adds to
            them the agenda of expressing different collectively-defined means of defining and measuring value, to build
            an open, new economic space. Building a whole economy represents a profound change in direction for
            cryptodesign. We call it the Economic Space Protocol.<sup class="footNote" id="fn12">12</sup> The Economic
            Space Protocol is the language that network participants, through their agents,<sup class="footNote"
                id="fn13">13</sup> use to interact, program and operate an economic space. These social and economic
            interactions are of the participants’ own determination, but not in circumstances of their own choosing. It
            is important to highlight that the existence of the network and its protocols is the foundation of
            interactions between participants: they interact <em>through</em> the network.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u79" class="unit available">
        <p>But nor is the network imposed on participants. Although an agent ensures adherence to the protocol, when the
            protocols are designed the ‘right’ way, participants operate in an open and coordinated space where they can
            collectively assert sovereignty over the network; not via a central authority, but via distributed network
            governance. Choice is individual and sovereignty is collective. The objective of design is to enable a
            process of sovereignty that sees participant decisions incentivized to enhance shared goals. The effect
            would be to bring the collective and each participant into alignment.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u80" class="unit available">
        <p>Framed this way, the economy is a programmable, designable medium: not in a mechanistic, reductionist sense
            of guaranteed processes and outcomes, but in the sense that how the economy works and its key
            conventions&mdash;the kind of relations, interactions, agents, incentives and values the network operates
            under&mdash;can become simultaneously an automation space and a design space, continuously open to its
            participants. We started this chapter with the contention that crypto developments have not yet given focus
            to new ways of producing, or what we prefer to call ‘performances.’<sup class="footNote" id="fn14">14</sup>
            Performances involve processes of new value creation. Understood more broadly than ‘production,’
            performances can focus on issues of social meaning, shared risk taking, and affect. It is important,
            therefore, that our initial approach to the Economic Space Protocol centers on performances. The Economic
            Space Protocol sets out three critical features of performances:</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u81" class="unit available">
        <p>  <em>New forms of economic participation.</em> Capitalism produces one form of incentives, one form of
            ownership, one money system and one stream of value.<sup class="footNote" id="fn15">15</sup> The Economic
            Space Protocol enables a different stream of value, with different incentives, ownership and tokens. Agents
            in the network design their own performance expressions, including the internal relations of performing and
            the social outcomes they claim for their outputs.<sup class="footNote" id="fn16">16</sup> These relations,
            as well as the outcomes of a performance will be evaluated by the network as contributions to the creation
            of new economic value. The network is not specifying exactly how ‘postcapitalist production’ should be
            organized, but when protocols are not designed around extractive class relations, the most suitable forms of
            performance relations are created by agents themselves.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u82" class="unit available">
        <p>  <em>Reciprocal staking.</em> All agents invest in other agents. They invest not from a store of ‘money,’
            but by giving up stake in themselves. Hence staking is reciprocal. The network will involve an evolving web
            of connections of stake ownership, creating the conditions for a network commons.<sup class="footNote"
                id="fn17">17</sup> Agents therefore have financial, strategic and emotional skin-in-the-game across the
            network. Individual agents want their performances&mdash;their offers to the network&mdash;to be evaluated
            by the network as to whether they are deemed to create value for the network, and this evaluation determines
            the rewards for staking (‘dividends’).</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u83" class="unit available">
        <p>  <em>New modes of valuing.</em> When agents reciprocally stake and make their specific staking decisions on
            who in the network is creating valuable social output, they are signaling what they believe creates a
            ‘collectively defined value.’<sup class="footNote" id="fn18">18</sup> This signaling will be formed into
            network-generated units of measurement (see Chapter&nbsp;7), so that agents in the network are participating
            in both creating value and defining what constitutes a ‘collectively defined value.’</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u84" class="unit available">
        <p>These three features are interrelated in ways that will unfold in subsequent chapters. In effect, we have
            taken the collective values of the commons and designed a way to reconcile them with market relations.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u85" class="unit available">
        <p>Our goal is to build distributed economic relations that privilege collectively-expressed values and the
            creation and distribution of outputs (and their outcomes) that comply with, and are motivated by, those
            values. So the significance of starting with performances is that it gives focus to <em>shared flows of
                value creation</em>, and the incentives to risk in generating those flows, not on the issue of
            <em>individual decisions to buy and sell</em>. This focus is the key to building a network with a collective
            momentum, rather than being a forum for trading per se.</p>

    </div>
    <div id="u87" class="unit available">
        <p>By this point, readers will have already come across some terms that are new, or familiar words being
            configured in new ways. In a project such as ours, it is always a dilemma whether to invent new terms or to
            try and wrest familiar terms from their narrow historic framings. We have done some of each, and carefully
            considered how to get that balance right. To assist readers in this interpretation, we provide a glossary to
            terminology developed in the Economic Space Agency.<sup class="footNote" id="fn19">19</sup></p>
    </div>
    <div id="u88" class="unit available">
        <p>There are three terms, which have already appeared, that need some degree of clarification at this stage:
            staking, tokens and value. The clarification here is definitely preliminary, and we will reprise and
            elaborate these terms on a number of occasions as the analysis develops.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u89" class="unit available">
        <p><em>Staking</em>. In cryptoeconomics, staking has recently become prevalent, but with multiple different
            points of emphasis. One use of the term arises in the context of ‘proof-of-stake,’<sup class="footNote"
                id="fn20">20</sup> where people stake their holdings of a token as collateral to become validators of
            ledger transfers of that token. A second form of staking is lending tokens that others may borrow (e.g. for
            use in derivative trades), generating a speculative yield to ownership. A third is collateralizing (staking)
            tokens for a loan in a stabletoken, which can then again be invested or staked (and the process rinsed and
            repeated, many times). These practices led to token markets becoming increasingly leveraged, and susceptible
            to the price crash that happened in 2022.<sup class="footNote" id="fn21">21</sup></p>
    </div>
    <div id="u90" class="unit available">
        <p>A fourth use of the term staking involves locking tokens to a protocol’s staking contract in return for
            certain ‘rights.’<sup class="footNote" id="fn22">22</sup> As a type, this form of staking is one application
            of our use of the term. In our analysis, staking involves taking on a financial exposure to the
            success/failure of another person or group’s (agent’s) creation of output. In aggregate, it gives a network
            a shared exposure to the future. It is a process of investing in new performance, and it generates returns
            based on the success of that process. Some in cryptoeconomics (e.g. Walden 2020) talk of the importance of
            intertemporal commitment in an ‘ownership economy,’ and our view broadly aligns with this.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u91" class="unit available">
        <p><em>Tokens</em>. By definition, tokens are an exclusive, transferable and quantifiable set of rights, but in
            many people’s initial understanding, they are simply alternatives to the state’s fiat currency, with bitcoin
            as the chief referenced challenger. In both cases, these are issued centrally by a third party. The state’s
            issuance rests on the reputation of the state; bitcoin’s on a widespread belief in the blockchain, its
            finite quantum and its cultural statement. Both are believed (and agreed) to be a store of value; one (for
            now) deemed ‘safe’; the other volatile, but a store nonetheless.</p>
    </div>

        <p>The tokens we introduce are neither centrally issued nor do they store wealth in themselves: there is no
            ‘money’ in the conventional sense. Instead, in a distributed network (without a central 3rd party
            authority), tokens are issued by individuals/collectives (agents) to transfer an exclusive set of rights to
            an underlying value, be it a good, a service or an asset. Tokens are at the service of a ledger, and the
            balance on the ledger records the good service or asset being transferred in one direction and a token
            transferred in the other direction. The question, of course, is what you can do with a token issued by
            another person. Answering this will take us into details our analysis is not yet ready to reveal but, to
            give some answer, those tokens are associated with the settlement of credit.<sup class="footNote"

        <p><em>Value.</em> This concept has two general meanings. One relates to values as an ethical frame (as in
            personal values). The other relates to value as a quantifiable statement of what something is worth. Those
            two may overlap significantly (a quantified ethics), but the second concept of value has a meaning as a unit
            of commensuration (or foundation for establishing equivalence), as in Marx’s ‘labor theory of value.’ There,
            the term may be used in relation to the system of value calculation and analysis, or to the quantified worth
            of a particular thing (the value of/attributed to a cup of coffee, according to the adopted theory of
            value). We note the importance of the first, ethical meaning but do not discuss it, although we take it as
            the impulse to frame value theory in a particular way. In our analysis, we use the term value to mean both
            the abstract system of calculation, and the concrete valuation of particular outputs. However, it needs to
            be said that theories of value, of all varieties, perform best as indicative of social processes rather than
            formal calculative systems.</p>

        <h5>1.5 Capitalist and postcapitalist finance</h5>
    </div>
    <div id="u95" class="unit available">
        <p>Earlier in this chapter we gave focus to finance as the frontier of capitalist economic change and from where
            postcapitalism must develop. We then shifted to our own priority of building postcapitalist performances of
            value creation. So how do we frame the connection from capitalist frontiers of finance to a postcapitalist
            economy of value-creation? This connection forms the substance of the rest of this book, but our path into
            it starts by depicting the difference between capitalism and postcapitalism as a financial ‘spread.’</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u96" class="unit available">
        <p>The core questions that define the financial spread are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>What counts as liquidity?</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>What counts as collateral?</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>What counts as ‘surplus’ and</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Who decides each of these?</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div id="u97" class="unit available">
        <p><em>The liquidity question</em>. Who has the right to issue? In capitalism liquidity is about the state, the
            banking system it superintends and the money it endorses. When only those state-approved agents can issue,
            then a liquidity premium (a rate of return on money) can be charged for the risks involved in holding
            illiquid assets, because an exchange may not be found quickly.<sup class="footNote" id="fn24">24</sup> The
            new economic space challenges this hegemony as the source of money issuance, proposing instead p2p
            reciprocal issuance amongst agents in a network. But what they issue is not ‘money’ as conventionally
            understood. Tokens in the network we propose are not private money, but claims on other agents: offers from
            one agent that are accepted by another and registered by the transfer of a token. Where all agents can issue
            in this sense, there need be no network shortage of liquidity and hence no liquidity premium.<sup
                class="footNote" id="fn25">25</sup> The provision of liquidity can be fully collateralized by stake, and
            this collateral, rather than a liquidity premium, covers lending risk.<sup class="footNote"
                id="fn26">26</sup> Because collateral derives from the process of reciprocal staking it is the network
            overall that carries default risk. Stake becomes the complement of liquidity.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u98" class="unit available">
        <p><em>The collateral question.</em> Who gets to determine what ‘assets’ are, and how they can be utilized for
            leverage? In capitalism, asset prices, and hence value as collateral, are linked to their capacity to
            generate future profit. Workers' primary asset&mdash;their capacity to work&mdash;is only collateral in the
            context of slavery and student debt. In the new economic space, agents' performances that create ‘value’ (as
            defined collectively by the network) forms the basis of collateral, for stake price is linked to value
            creation. In capitalism it is the capacity to create profit that defines stake as collateral; in
            postcapitalism, it is the capacity to create collectively defined value that defines stake as collateral.
            And because performances will be undertaken within non-extractive work relations, all participants have a
            stake and hence a claim to collateral.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u99" class="unit available">
        <p><em>The surplus question.</em> What proportion of output is in excess of the costs of producing it, and who
            lays claim to the excess? The former is a measurement question; the latter the social access (class)
            question. Historically the determination of surplus was a process of extraction. In slavery and feudalism
            the surplus is that output in excess of the costs of sustaining slaves or a peasant class of producers. It
            is predominantly a surplus in the form of goods and services. In capitalism surplus is a financial concept
            because it is implied that all the components of output and hence the ‘excess’ can be commensurated, via
            units of value.<sup class="footNote" id="fn27">27</sup> Surplus takes the financial form of rent, interest
            or profit.<sup class="footNote" id="fn28">28</sup> Postcapitalism opens the question of how a surplus is to
            be defined (how costs and outputs are to be specified and measured: units of value and the unit of exchange)
            and claims of access to this surplus. In particular, where value is not defined by reference to profit,
            (some part of) surplus may be attributable to a commons.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u100" class="unit available">
        <p><em>The ‘who gets to decide?’ question.</em> ‘Who has financial power?’ is the financial version of ‘class.’
            In capitalism, wealth and power are expressed critically in the capacity to decree the issuance of money and
            the valuation of assets.<sup class="footNote" id="fn29">29</sup> In postcapitalism, all agents can issue
            assets to be used as collateral, other agents in the network have the capacity to accept these assets as
            collateral, and all collateral can serve to back liquidity. Implicit here is the idea that a postcapitalism,
            when framed through finance, can be depicted as an economy of abundance. This is not in the sense that too
            many commodities are produced, or that no-one will want for anything, but that when ‘value’ has diverse
            forms (not just profit-based) and is determined via distributed processes, we will all discover an abundance
            of economic activity, verified by a plethora of economic data analytics, which was hitherto performed
            without social recognition, and thereby no doubt under-performed.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u101" class="unit available">
        <p>We have mentioned the speed of change in cryptoeconomic history. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has already
            introduced stablecoins as mechanisms for token exchange rate stability with respect to fiat currencies and
            pooling mechanisms for stabilizing token prices. More recently, it is introducing to cryptoeconomics the
            possibilities of distributed banking and insurance: that assets need not lie idle, but can be mobilized for
            borrowing and lending and with mechanisms of insurance offered on the side. The emergence of a
            rapidly-growing market for Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) is further accelerating this development, creating
            marketable assets whose sale creates collateral for further rounds of lending. Lending is then giving rise
            to the potential for leverage: borrowing in order to take positions in markets. That, in turn, is opening up
            issues like collateral requirements with margin calls and default risk. Predictably, we are already seeing
            the issuance of derivative financial products like credit default swaps (CDS) and collateralized debt
            obligations (CDOs) designed to on-sell default risk from those who wish to avoid it to those prepared to
            carry it for a fee.<sup class="footNote" id="fn30">30</sup></p>
    </div>
    <div id="u102" class="unit available">
        <p>We can note in passing that these latter developments have the hallmark of the sorts of derivative products
            being traded in the lead-up to the 2007 global financial crisis. Whether they are pointing to crypto’s
            ‘Minsky moment’<sup class="footNote" id="fn31">31</sup> ‘is another matter, for the products themselves were
            never the source of crisis; it was their governance, expressed in pricing models and the conditions of
            access to leverage they were built upon. It is not surprising, therefore, that the emergence of
            ’crypto-derivatives’ and a focus on DeFi governance are emerging concurrently. Whether they are emerging
            compatibly remains to be seen.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u103" class="unit available">
        <p>Nonetheless, we should note the enormous potential in the development of NFTs as derivatives on performances.
            The current focus in relation to NFTs creating a market for digital images should not obscure the potential
            to frame performances&mdash;value creating processes&mdash;as NFTs, and hence the ownership of NFTs as a
            financial exposure to the processes of future value creation. The relative simplicity of their issuance
            could open up a vastly new vision of how NFTs could be central tools of social innovation.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u104" class="unit available">
        <p>What sorts of derivative products might be exchanged in the new economic space? The answer is that there
            could be any and all of the above: agents can offer for exchange whatever they decide to. Governance of the
            network must be cognisant of the potential for ‘Minsky moments.’ In general, our interest is in derivatives
            that embed the social. We invoke, after Randy Martin, the ‘social logic of the derivative.’<sup
                class="footNote" id="fn32">32</sup> As ‘the social’ in the new economic space is conceived as a network,
            we will use the term ‘network derivatives.’ This means taking the logic of financial derivatives (futures,
            options and swaps)<sup class="footNote" id="fn33">33</sup> and giving them network application as a
            collective value creating process. Here, the emphasis is on decomposed ‘things’ conventionally conceived as
            singular into their exposures (information, potentials and risks) so that they may be reconfigured as new
            creative directions. They enable the network to take positions on what counts as value, what counts as
            collateral and how liquidity creates social connection.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u105" class="unit available">
        <p>In particular, our financial approach to derivatives requires designing the optimal combination of
            price-determination conditions (what conventional economics calls decision-making under uncertainty) and
            flow-of-value conditions (what Marxism calls accumulation). When we get that balance right, we can target
            the ways to depict positions (decision-making) on social volatility (a flow). In effect, we are defining the
            potential of a spread in which agents risk. Expressed as stake choices and value creation, it sees agents
            making <em>individual</em> decisions to embrace a <em>social</em> conception of what is valuable.</p>

        <p>We have seen people active in art and design, the p2p movement and open source software engineers show close
            interest in our proposal, and we feel confident that the appeal of our vision will spread as its insights
            are understood. The proposition is not that we will simply ‘transfer’ to the new economy, but that we can
            spend part, and a growing part, of our economic lives in the new economic space.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u109" class="unit available">
        <p>Financially, we can frame capitalism and postcapitalism as a spread. Investing in the new economic space is
            trading the spread, taking a long position of an alternative to capitalist modes of valuing. But we also
            depict it as a short position: those who recognize pointers to capitalism’s loss of legitimacy may want to
            place a bet against capitalism. Bitcoin may be a short position on capitalist money. Our proposal offers a
            short position on the capitalist economy and culture.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u110" class="unit available">
        <p>Our aspiration is that people will traverse the spread by being drawn towards participation in our
            postcapitalist vision and, in so doing, will in some degree reduce their current engagement with capitalism.
            Our hope is that more and more people will spend more and more of their time engaging with and through the
            Economic Space Protocol. But in reality, we will be <em>living inside the spread.</em></p>
    </div>
    <div id="u111" class="unit available">
        <p>But we must conclude this introduction with a caution. All the above propositions assume the citizen
            capacities of liberal democracies and, within those democracies, there is the presumption that states will
            not regulate so as to subvert the development of proposals such as those of the new economic space. The
            threat of subversion-by-regulation points to a general political struggle for the right to think and
            organize differently, without denying the importance of the principle of the rule of law. We also understand
            that, in certain societies, distributed protocols, for all their internal stateless organization, are under
            the surveillance and control of centralized states intent on enforcing ideological compliance. In these
            places, there is no capacity to ‘live in the spread.’ These serious concerns point to a
            politics-beyond-choice; to forms of fascism. We emphasize our opposition to these regimes, and note that the
            struggle against them is a struggle for us all.</p>

                    production to be organized through reciprocal economic relations and the pursuit of

    <div id="u117" class="unit available">
        <p>As an architecture, the Economic Space Protocol’s approach to architecture is one where the protocol
            distributes records across a network of physical devices residing in different locations. There is no
            singular shared recording data structure, that is, the blockchain, but a network of nodes, each holding its
            records with remote references to those of others. Rather than relying on secrecy through cryptographically
            encoded records, it relies on privacy, where records start by being accessible only to their owner and
            located in the node where the owner created them. It is the owner who progressively shares them according to
            the logic of the network’s protocol. So in the network there are private records, shared records, public
            records, and everything in-between. The protocol connects these records through remote references, creating
            a physically distributed data structure instead of relying on a partially encrypted globally replicated
            linked list as its recording medium.</p>

        <p>Agents can determine which of their records they share at any point in time through offers (smart-contract

        <p>Is cryptoeconomy just a refinement and acceleration of a capitalist economy or can it create new economic
            space? It could be either or, indeed, both. The platforms that utilize blockchain and cryptographic
            technologies can be placed at the service of protocols that are essentially capitalist, or postcapitalist
            protocols that are conceived more cooperatively and commons-oriented&mdash;designed around shared
            aspirations, financial innovation and risking together. The technology permits both capitalist and
            postcapitalist versions to be designed centrally or in a distributed way. Importantly, framed this way, the
            postcapitalist agenda can be seen as no less practicable than a formally designed, distributed capitalism,
            and we can provide a clear depiction of <em>the difference</em> between the two. In both cases, there are
            cost and speed advantages of cryptoeconomic platforms because of the absence of need for central clearing
            houses, and we already see large corporations and states adopting the technology for fast, reliable, low
            cost and accurate record keeping. But there is a politics here, too. The emergence of central bank digital
            currencies is a stark statement.<sup class="footNote" id="fn36">36</sup> It is not essential for states to

            would be to suggest that we know the end point. Rather, our objective is about network processes without
            specifying particular outcomes and hence without claims to their efficiency or harmony. We want to build the
            protocol on which <em>narratives of the future</em> can be built. We need to rethink what we mean by
            ‘production’ of value, where what constitutes ‘value’ is an open question, and where the motivations for
            engaging in, and staking, value creation are themselves as important as the outputs created. We need to
            reframe what markets are and what they could be as network relations without reference to profit and without
            a centralized operator. These dimensions will be revealed as the analysis unfolds.</p>

        <p>Accordingly, we turn to some basic principles of capitalist economics and start to focus on the ways in which
            they might (and might not) articulate with the potentials of a cryptoeconomy. In particular, our agenda is
            to pick apart certain standard economic categories in a detailed way, to ensure that we don’t simply carry
            over concepts and approaches that will ultimately inhibit our project. But nor do we assume there is nothing
            to learn from the conventional knowledge. On the contrary, we need to blend the new with relevant lessons

        <p>Economics is a broad and contested discipline. It is also an old one, with Adam Smith’s <em>Wealth of
                Nations</em> almost 250 years old, and Karl Marx’s economics 180 years old. Back then it was debated as
            ‘political economy,’ with a narrower discipline of ‘economics’&mdash;locking the social into a set of
            simplifying assumptions&mdash;dating only from the late 19th century. That narrowing involved the emergence
            of ‘neo-classical’ economics which remains hegemonic, more than 100 years on. It has, of course,
            significantly evolved over the past century, but the approach to ‘the social’ has varied little. It reduces
            the social to a set of behavioral abstractions (protocols), generally idealizations (<em>homo
                economicus</em> as their agent), which equate social goals with the operation of ‘free’ markets
            (businesses maximizing their profits; consumers maximizing their ‘utility’) and restrict the state’s role to
            market facilitation. Theoretical innovations have generally been about adding complexity (e.g. game theory)
            and exploring ‘distortions’ (e.g. asymmetrical information; behavioral deviations from <em>homo
                economicus</em>). It presents as an <em>orthodoxy</em>, quite unlike the rest of the social sciences
            that are conceived in continuous theoretical and methodological debate. Moreover, it is not merely an
            orthodoxy but, as a socially decisive discourse, it is <em>performative</em>: this theory of markets and
            <em>homo economicus</em> are less an attempt to <em>describe society</em>, than an engineering effort to
            <em>remake society</em> in its own image, predicated on the assumptions of individualism, self-interest and
            the universal aspiration of profitability articulated through (predominantly) market relations. It has the
            template for the kinds of people and interactions it wants and, if permitted to run, it will find and train
            players to behave according to its model. In the era of cryptoeconomics we can describe this engineering
            effort as building protocols of social performance.<sup class="footNote" id="fn37">37</sup></p>

    <div id="u132" class="unit available">
        <p>But that orthodoxy is under new challenge, especially with the capacities of cryptocurrencies and
            cryptographically enabled distributed systems. We see the rise of a sub-discipline of ‘cryptoeconomics’ as a
            distinct field of analysis. However, we are concerned that the propositions of cryptoeconomics have so far
            engaged in a limited way in the social and political theory that lies behind their ‘alternative’
            economics.<sup class="footNote" id="fn38">38</sup></p>

        <p>Generally, challenges to the orthodoxy depict themselves as ‘political economy,’ picking up on the 18th and
            19th century recognition that economics and politics (the social) cannot be separated.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u134" class="unit available">
        <p>In modern usage, ‘political economy’ emerged in the 1950’s as part of a radical rejection of capitalist class
            relations. Some branches reached back to Marx’s propositions about the contradictions of capitalism and the
            emergence of a politicized working class to resist oppression, creating the way for a self-organizing
            society.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u135" class="unit available">
        <p>Others developed a political economy that focussed on reforms of the state intended to make society fairer,
            more equal and more sustainable. Rather than a revolutionary politics, these reformers advocated a social
            democratic state, often looking to Scandinavian societies as their model. Both schools of political economy
            lost potency in the 1980’s and 90’s.</p>

            capitalism. On the other hand, the rise in the west of ‘neo-liberalism’ saw the state operating as the
            obstacle to ‘progressive’ reform, not as its agent. Simply advocating what a ‘good’ state <em>should</em> do
            lacked any real politics.</p>

        <p>But there was an emerging undercurrent of political economy, now coming from the ‘right’ of politics, that
            came to the fore in these contexts. It is most readily associated with the name Friedrich von Hayek&mdash;a
            rather marginal libertarian economist living in the shadow of Keynes and the (broadly) Marxists, but who
            came to public prominence in the 1970s as the theoretical guru of UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher: the
            person many attribute as the instigator of ‘neoliberalism.’</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u139" class="unit available">
        <p>We start with Hayek not because we see ourselves as being in the tradition of Hayek&mdash;quite the
            contrary&mdash;but because Hayek is so popular within the cryptoeconomic community. We will later have
            reason to draw on other economic traditions, especially Marx, Sraffa and Keynes. But in all cases the agenda
            is <em>not</em> to give a ‘Hayekian,’ ‘Marxian’ or ‘Keynesian’ take on cryptoeconomics: indeed we believe
            that the technologies of the internet, cryptography and a blockchain would have been challenging for all
            past thinkers and would have caused them to re-think some of their core analysis.<sup class="footNote"
                id="fn39">39</sup> But what we can do is look at their methods (rather than their conclusions) and ask
            how these might be applied in the current era, to see what insights we can glean. Indeed, we conjecture that
            this framing will lead to conclusions often quite different from those that appear in the emerging
            cryptoeconomic literature.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u140" class="unit available">
        <p>Hayek was vehemently anti-socialist, but he had major conflicts with the neoclassical economists too. He
            embraced individual self interest as the premise of social order but thought the neo-classicals adopted two
            positions he opposed.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u141" class="unit available">
        <p>First, he opposed their conception of ‘equilibrium’ as an optimal state. His preferred notion was
            ‘spontaneous order.’ That term might seem a close approximation of equilibrium, but the difference is
            critical. For Hayek, the quality of markets he affirmed was that they process complex information into
            simple information (prices). That is an intrinsic virtue, distinct from any claims that markets would
            somehow gravitate to balance or optimisation. It is the process that Hayek valued; not the outcome.
            Information processing is clearly critical to programming an economy; it is an issue to which we will
            return.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u142" class="unit available">
        <p>Second, Hayek opposed the conventional endorsement of the state in economic management. The state, he
            contended, is innately authoritarian, imposing its will on society: sometimes well-intentioned but flawed;
            other times clearly enhancing the power of the state itself.<sup class="footNote" id="fn40">40</sup> The
            market, claimed Hayek, is the natural site of freedom of expression and a means to generate spontaneous
            social order.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u143" class="unit available">
        <p>Of course the popular critique is that markets, if left to themselves, create massive inequality,
            environmental destruction, etc.. Not so, said Hayek. It is the inadequate specification of property rights
            and the rules of markets (that we reveal as a distributed protocol) that are the problem, and when states
            tinker with outcomes (levies and bounties) they generally mess up. Most critically, they mess up the
            provision of a state-sanctioned money system (fiat money).</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u144" class="unit available">
        <p>Not surprisingly, Hayek has had great appeal in cryptoeconomics. On the surface, they are a near perfect fit.
            A cryptoeconomic order conceived in a rejection of the state as economic manager, including as provider of
            the sole monetary system, and instead focussing on data analytics and optimizing individuals in contractual
            transactions, seems to resonate deeply with Hayek. So too does the idea, expressed in his <em>The Fatal
                Conceit</em> (1988), of the need to break up conventional, secure but distorting practices.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u145" class="unit available">
        <p>We can readily source essays on cryptoeconomics that celebrate the self-directed individual and claim
            foundations in Hayek.<sup class="footNote" id="fn41">41</sup> It should be noted that, knowingly or not, the
            idealization of individualism, profit and the market as foundational social relations come as integral to
            the Hayek package and those foundations are being transmitted, perhaps not always intentionally, into
            cryptoeconomic culture. This adoption leaves unquestioned the issues of what we count and how we measure:
            both of which embody the potentially transformative politics of cryptoeconomics.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u146" class="unit available">
        <p>In creating new economic space, we are opening the opportunity for a different economic calculus. Our
            proposition is that knowledge, prices and their relation to markets need to be re-thought. What Hayek and
            conventional economics, and their digital disciples, take as foundational in relation to markets, we think
            are protocols. As protocols, they are designable in different ways. But Hayek and his followers seem to
            think not. They analyze ‘the market’ as a platform: culturally foundational and economically ‘natural.’ For
            them, the market is depicted as a neutral technology into which individuals bring their strategic interests
            and which, if allowed to operate as it ‘should,’ will create ‘equilibrium’ (neoclassical economics) and
            ‘spontaneous order’ (Hayek). The social ‘good’/‘harm,’ the commons, the environment, that sit outside these
            individual interests can only be framed as ‘externalities,’ and hence second order considerations.<sup
                class="footNote" id="fn42">42</sup></p>
    </div>
    <div id="u147" class="unit available">
        <p>What stands as contestable, and where we will focus our analysis, is the question of what we mean by
            ‘markets,’ ‘price mechanisms’ and their relations with ‘society.’ Markets are socially constructed, not
            ‘natural,’ and they embed particular social protocols. Markets transmit a range of information; not just
            price. Moreover ‘price’ itself transmits information, but it is always encoded in a particular way of
            measuring. So markets, as spaces of exchange, need not relate to profit, but can be designed to generate the
            sorts of information a network needs. As they currently are utilized, they are fundamentally directed to
            serving the pursuit of profit-making. In summary, market processes are not innately capitalist and their
            logic is not innately extractive (expressing social dominance).</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u148" class="unit available">
        <p>If we can isolate the process of market interactions from a social context of wealth, power and inequality,
            and redesign them at the center of a distributed postcapitalist economy, they can be seen as means of voting
            for economic outcomes, articulating individual views about what constitutes value. Issues of social benefit
            and harm, the environment, etc. in capitalism must be either contrived into profit calculus or treated as
            ‘externalities,’ and essentially outside of market calculus. We want to bring them inside market calculus by
            adapting market processes to value the things that we know to be socially important, but which are left out
            of capitalist markets. We shouldn’t conflate markets-under-capitalism with
            markets-as-information-transmission processes.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u149" class="unit available">
        <p>In the new economic space, markets are explicitly defined by distributed network protocols. They are spaces
            of exchange and valuation: they structure the space of possibilities for interactions and for the economic
            properties of the objects populating such spaces. A market is a network and is defined by offer, matching,
            netting and clearing protocols that its agents must adopt in order to interoperate as a coherent whole.</p>

        <p>In the mid 20th century, Hayek and his Austrian School colleagues opened a debate with advocates of (broadly)

            <p>It is in this connection that what I have called the ‘economic calculus’ proper helps us, at least by
                analogy, to see how this problem can be solved, and in fact is being solved, by the price system. Even
                the single controlling mind [the central planner], in possession of all the data for some small,
                self-contained economic system, would not—every time some small adjustment in the allocation of
                resources had to be made—go explicitly through all the relations between ends and means which might
                possibly be affected. It is indeed the great contribution of the pure logic of choice that it has
                demonstrated conclusively that even such a single mind could solve this kind of problem only by
                constructing and constantly using rates of equivalence (or ‘values,’ or ‘marginal rates of
                substitution’), i.e., by attaching to each kind of scarce resource a numerical index which cannot be
                derived from any property possessed by that particular thing, but which reflects, or in which is
                condensed, its significance in view of the whole means-end structure. In any small change he will have
                to consider only these quantitative indices (or ‘values’) in which all the relevant information is
                concentrated; and, by adjusting the quantities one by one, he can appropriately rearrange his
                dispositions without having to solve the whole puzzle <em>ab initio</em> or without needing at any stage

        <p>So Hayek has identified a critical issue: that markets, as a protocol, construct indices of measurement, in
            this case a rate of exchange, so that any small component of the economy can be commensurated against the
            whole, for this is the condition of tracing how a change in that small thing impacts the whole. This is an
            issue we return to consistently: the construction of distinctly postcapitalist communication networks and
            ways of measurement.</p>

    <div id="u156" class="unit available">
        <p>Hayek’s notion of ‘free’ markets and prices transmitting information may be one technical ‘solution’ (if we

                class="footNote" id="fn45">45</sup>), but it is only one, and a decidedly capitalist, ‘solution.’ For
            Hayek, price is the reduction of complexly-layered knowledge to a single index. With everyone speaking the
            language of price and the pursuit of profit as a singular objective for decision-making, market interactions
            are said to generate spontaneous order, but what they actually do is to structure the space of the possible.
            Hayek’s mid 20th century advocacy of ‘the market’ and trust in ‘prices’ may stand strong as an alternative
            to Soviet central planning, but 75 years on the argument must be different.</p>

        <p>It is important to understand that alternative economic indexes can be based in different knowledge,

            economic performance(s) and surpluses and to trigger trading strategies for agents that lead to wider
            economic decisions about what is produced and how. We want to avoid automatic reliance on indices that embed
            profit maximizing strategies or situate in monetary processes driven by interest extraction. We depict our
            preferred measures as the performance indices of the new economic space. Performance indices are explored in

        <p>We should note the way in which Hayek depicts price as a simplified index that obviates the need for agents

                only to those concerned. It is more than a metaphor to describe the price system as a kind of machinery
                for registering change, or a system of telecommunications which enables individual producers to watch
                merely the movement of a few pointers, as an engineer might watch the hands of a few dials, in order to
                adjust their activities to changes of which they never know more than is reflected in the price
                movement. (Hayek, 1945: 526–27)</p>

        <p>It would be a misrepresentation of Hayek to read from this quote that prices are the <em>only</em> data on
            which agents make decisions: after all, no-one buys anything simply because of its price. Price may initiate
            exchange as the trigger information, but it is not sufficient information to explain exchange.<sup

            conditions’ and they trade on the basis of their subjective preferences, informed by whatever information
            they choose to utilize. The brilliance of markets, he thought, is the reduction of a complexity of data to a
            single index of exchange.<sup class="footNote" id="fn47">47</sup> Through price signals, markets transmit
            ‘tacit’ or ‘dispersed’ knowledge. But, for all the information individuals may potentially

            an output and the interactions around its creation and exchange are thereby lost when price is elevated as
            the form in which knowledge is transmitted. Yet we now know that, in the current world, social media and
            on-line marketing are assembling all sorts of data about individuals, their velleities, ‘attributes’ and
            networks. In these ‘attention markets’ price is just one amongst many data points valued by corporations. A

        <p>Price is not the condensation of knowledge. Price is, after all, no more than one index: it measures
            <em>relative</em> exchange values (between commodities; over time). But in the hands of Hayek (and the
            neo-classicals), with their version of ‘the market’ naturalized as a platform, price can be treated socially
            as an <em>absolute</em> social measure. Indeed this is the analytical objective: to create the impression
            that price formation is the social expression of the natural order of markets. Prices slide from being
            technically relative values framed in a particular social and economic context to being presented as

        <p>Our starting point is that information must ‘from the start’ be an expression of social values, in the same
            way that Hayek’s information ‘from the start’ expresses capitalist values. Our postcapitalist network will
            require data on flows of intentions, affect and emotional commitments&mdash;expressions of the sorts of
            values that will frame the direction of this economy&mdash;for these data will inform the debates and
            choices about making that future.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u165" class="unit available">
        <p>Prices in a capitalist economy are determined, generally, by the interaction of supply and demand. Demand may
            be all about individual ‘tastes’: their values, aesthetics, needs, etc.: a domain generally inaccessible to
            economics, except as data. Supply in a capitalist economy is more telling. It is dictated, other than in
            exceptional cases, by the condition of profitability. Whether adopting a competitive market explanation or a
            post-Keynesian mark-up (cost plus a rate of profit) explanation of prices, profitability is at the center.
            Producers will not supply to a market unless it is profitable to do so.<sup class="footNote"

    <div id="u166" class="unit available">
        <p>Further, prices-linked-to-profit are based in the way profit is calculated, and that points to the structure
            of accounting. There exists an extensive literature in the history of accounting, tying the system of double
            entry book-keeping to the rise of capitalism.<sup class="footNote" id="fn51">51</sup> Double entry
            book-keeping, as it developed, became central to the way wealth is specified as ‘capital’; how profit (the
            extraction of a surplus from production by the owners of capital) became legitimized by the mode of its
            inclusion into the structure of corporate accounts, and how the concept of ‘profit’ evolved as capitalism
            itself has evolved.<sup class="footNote" id="fn52">52</sup></p>
    </div>
    <div id="u167" class="unit available">
        <p>A postcapitalist economy cannot adopt capitalist modes of accounting. Yet, in parallel with our contentions
            about prices and markets, it is important to differentiate the particular capitalist application of double
            entry ledgers&mdash;the units in which measurement is recorded&mdash;from the logic of ledgers formulated
            with a system of entries and counter-entries. The use of tokens and a ledger-based accounting system are
            central to the Economic Space Protocol and in later chapters we will explore the way in which an economic
            space, with double entry book-keeping measured with a different units of value, opens the possibility for a
            different determination of ‘prices’ and designation of a surplus, and how these link to designing
            postcapitalist value.</p>

        <p>Indeed, as will be explained in Chapter&nbsp;4, combinations of information, and propositions of their
            economic significance (what we call ‘performances’), come to the fore as the critical, frontier products of
            the new economy. Giving meaning (even competing meanings) to information is the critical economic agenda for
            the future. This is about using information to create narratives of the future, as a way of opening up new
            possibilities, rather than codifying data into price for individual market choices. Why then is ‘price,’ as
            it is currently measured, the privileged index of valuation? Why do we not use (for example) sociality
            (social impact) as the privileged index of valuation? Or environmental impact? The answer is that these
            issues are not currently being tracked in the records (the ledgers) on which the current economy operates.

    </div>
    <div id="u171" class="unit available">
        <p>The challenge we’ve mounted is to make clear that the process of price formation ‘price,’ as it is
            conventionally understood, can be re-framed as just one set of protocols but not, as Hayek would have us
            believe, the <em>only</em> one. In the context of distributed ownership and distributed issuance of ‘money,’
            the social processes of the economy will be profoundly challenged.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u172" class="unit available">
        <p>Three challenges are pivotal, and they drive the analytical agenda of our analysis:</p>
        <p><em>Network value.</em> How does a network place a value on outputs not produced for sale in a market, for
            example an art display, creating green spaces, new open source technology and human care?<sup
                class="footNote" id="fn53">53</sup> Outputs-with-no-price cannot be interpreted in a Hayekian framing.
            Our preferred approach comes not via value in exchange, but via how agents in the network place a value on
            the performances which produce the outputs. We are interested in the <em>performance</em> of care; the
            <em>vision</em> of green space, the <em>potential</em> of open technology, and these cannot be framed in
            standard market analysis devoid of time, affect and contingency.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u173" class="unit available">
        <p>The role of the Economic Space Protocol is to build ways to express the value of outputs, without reliance on
            a direct price (see <a href="#3.5-Ways-of-pricing">Chapter&nbsp;3.5</a>.). Moreover, those who create
            outputs-with-no-price should participate in rewards based on social assessment of their contribution. The
            reward is to be understood simply as a share of a surplus created in production (see Chapter&nbsp;5 and <a
                href="#Appendix-5.2">Appendix&nbsp;5.2</a>).<sup class="footNote" id="fn54">54</sup></p>
    </div>
    <div id="u174" class="unit available">
        <p><em>Time.</em> Hayek works with a limited conception of time as purely linear, clock time. In credit,
            interest accrues over time, but time itself is analytically passive. Investment is explained as a return to
            entrepreneurship and foresight. Capital is a riddle: ‘Why,’ asks Hayek (1941: 60), ‘should the more
            time-consuming methods of production yield a greater return,’ and he answers it by reference to the
            requirements of technical change in production. In each case, there is simply clock time, and its importance
            is only to compare rates of return.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u175" class="unit available">
        <p>A network requires a different conception of time, for time is the condition of contingencies and what
            matters is the sequence of events (what financial markets call ‘tick time’).<sup class="footNote"
                id="fn55">55</sup></p>
    </div>
    <div id="u176" class="unit available">
        <p>In an exchange, the ledger-based processes of offers, matches, netting and clearing may all happen virtually
            instantaneously, as if timeless, but may take time to execute. Our analytical focus is the
            <em>duration</em>,<sup class="footNote" id="fn56">56</sup> or on the set of state changes required for the
            exchange. It logically forms an interval, and within the duration of this interval, while certain mechanical
            processes may be risk-free, contingencies are critical.<sup class="footNote" id="fn57">57</sup> In
            ‘performances,’ as we are framing them, this interval is occupied by the momentum for innovation, affect and
            social change. In standard analysis, these would be cast as ‘subjective’ and unmeasurable, though when they
            manifest in ‘price’ they suddenly become objective and measured. Tick time is defined by the rhythm of those
            momentums and dynamics: the focus is on the repetition of occurrences and patterns.<sup class="footNote"
                id="fn58">58</sup> It gives quantifiable access to the way in which people respond to a duration. More
            abstractly, and as we will explore in relation to units of account, tick time opens up the question of what
            is measured (what is deemed by the network as important to measure), how to measure it and the meanings of
            duration.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u177" class="unit available">
        <p>When we add time and contingency we open the conditions of a derivative framing not addressed by Hayek. In
            the era of blockchain and big data, and in the language of Gilles Deleuze we can ‘dividuate’ knowledge:
            break it down into its underlying, determining elements (that Hayek thought were too complex to code), but
            without necessarily aspiring to see those elements combined so as to ontologically privilege the totalized
            category of a singular ‘knowledge,’ linked to ‘price.’ Knowledge is a synthetic asset; an assembly of
            processed information. Its purpose does not have to be the formation of ‘market price.’<sup class="footNote"
                id="fn59">59</sup></p>
    </div>
    <div id="u178" class="unit available">
        <p><em>Liquidity</em>. In Hayekian analysis (and in conventional economic analysis) all markets are assumed to
            be liquid.<sup class="footNote" id="fn60">60</sup> The presumption of liquidity is required in order to
            assume that there is a single price for any good or service: there will be no need to discount from normal
            prices to secure a trade. This assumption forms the foundation of financial pricing models and conceptions
            of efficiency, be it the efficient markets hypothesis, the capital asset pricing model or the Black Scholes
            Merton options pricing model. Marx’s analysis also assumes liquidity: that buyers and sellers are in
            sufficient numbers to enable outputs to sell ‘at their value.’ The absence of liquidity is a definition of
            ‘crisis.’</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u179" class="unit available">
        <p>Where there are two prices&mdash;a bid-ask spread&mdash;it is unclear what is meant, in Hayekian discourse,
            by ‘price,’ and hence in the depth of knowledge that is said to condense into price.<sup class="footNote"
                id="fn61">61</sup> A spread framed simply as two prices points to inefficiency or distortion, not
            innovation (or an impossibility of telling the difference) and the momentum that gets focus is not the
            dynamic of innovation, but the dynamic of arbitrage and the process by which the spread closes. The point is
            that price risks are embedded in price but cannot be separated from price: a price alone cannot disclose the
            probability of the price changing, though a price spread can. Prices cannot be disentangled from derivatives
            of prices.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u180" class="unit available">
        <p>There is more here than this technical point, and our proposal needs to identify two critical factors.</p>
        <p>First, in a network of mutual credit issuance (which is yet to be elaborated), liquidity is an index of
            sociality: the preparedness of agents to issue credit and make markets is an expression of social engagement
            and trust in network protocols. The basis of trust is not that the state monetary authorities or banks will
            ‘do the right thing’ in their policy discretion, but that there is knowledge that a) all credit is fully
            collateralized (Chapter&nbsp;8); b) default risk will be spread across the network (because ownership is
            dispersed, see Chapter&nbsp;5) and c) all agents understand the liquidity requirements of others by
            understanding their own liquidity requirements (Chapter&nbsp;8). A breakdown of liquidity, such as happened
            in the 2007–2008 financial crisis and the 2019–2022 pandemic crisis, is itself a breakdown of sociality
            because the centralized financial system highlighted the difference between individual interest (wanting to
            receive liquidity, but not give it) and collective interest. In a distributed economic system, all economic
            agents must take responsibility for the provision of liquidity, and performance indices must produce
            measures to verify the need for and conditions of liquidity. This is why the mutual issuance of credit is
            critical to the Economic Space Protocol, for it makes provision of liquidity and the distributed, not
            hierarchical, sociality of the network integrally related.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u181" class="unit available">
        <p>Second, markets will see bid-ask spreads that cannot be presumed to close in the time interval implicit in an
            automated market making function of the network. In an equilibrium framing, this is a market failure, where
            prices aren’t adjusting to clear the market. But where the focus is on innovation, spreads are always
            opening up, the propensity is not towards balance, but dynamic change and the creation of a surplus by the
            network-as-a-whole. In the conventional analysis of a bid-ask spread, a profit is presumed to accrue by
            trading on the spread. In a postcapitalist network, the question to be addressed is: who lays claim to the
            surplus, and how can it be realized as a <em>social</em> surplus rather than a private one? This issue is
            addressed directly in <a href="#5.3-Returns-to-stakeholding">Chapter&nbsp;5.3</a> and <a

    <div id="u183" class="unit available">
        <p>We have gone through an engagement with Hayek (but also, indirectly, Marx, Keynes and others) to give focus
            to the proposition that markets and the prices they generate do not have to connect to profits, and profits
            are not the sole, nor indeed primary, measure of economic achievement. Our goal has been to contest these
            assumed links not just as an ethical stand in the name of social goals of equality and respect for the
            biosphere and humanity, but as an analytical proposition. We can ‘unpick’ the apparent logic that links
            individual interest to markets and markets to profits and ‘design’ market relations quite differently. They
            need not focus on prices, or profits or individuals, but they can generate information systems that can
            utilize indices other than price; a range of goals and of interand intra-agent relations. But they will
            still be markets&mdash;markets as communication networks. The objective of protocol design is to give an
            orderly opportunity to re-imagine the ways in which economic goals are set and measured. We are seeking to
            develop the protocols for utilizing network-generated data to keep social goals&mdash;multiple

        <h5>Appendix&nbsp;2.1 Do ‘big Data’ Change the Story?</h5>
    </div>
    <div id="u185" class="unit available">
        <p>There is now a growing literature proclaiming that the emergence of big data is dramatically transforming,
            even abolishing capitalism (e.g. Zuboff, 2019). Often Hayek’s work forms a point of departure. Viktor
            Mayer-Schönberger and Thomas Ramge, the authors of <em>Reinventing Capitalism in the Age of Big
                Data</em>,<sup class="footNote" id="fn62">62</sup> for example, tell us that we no longer need to see
            all knowledge reduced to ‘prices.’ Directly-accessed data will supplement and in some ways supplant prices
            as the critical source of information. This, they say, challenges the role of money in a capitalist society.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="u186" class="unit available">
        <p>We half agree. The standing of a unitary measure of price as the driver of exchange can and should be under
            challenge. Other metrics will themselves be indexified and those indices tokenized. Diverse tokens will
            express a ‘market’ for innovation in social valuation: a market potentially far more important than
            competition over prices.<sup class="footNote" id="fn63">63</sup> But we do not agree that this is a
            challenge to the role of money, nor to capitalism itself.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u187" class="unit available">
        <p>In popular debate, big data are framed as individual surveillance by corporations and states, and hence a
            privacy and civil liberties issue.<sup class="footNote" id="fn64">64</sup> This, too, resonates with a
            Hayekian focus on the rights of individuals. Yet big data are also what national and international
            statistical agencies collect to enable a monitoring of dispersed processes in order to build an aggregate
            depiction of the economy, and to feed into economic policy formation. Clearly, the categories in which those
            data are assembled themselves embed a particular social and economic approach to society.<sup
                class="footNote" id="fn65">65</sup> So there is an immediate contradiction that big data, cast as a
            digital record of ‘the social,’ will be used against society. For Hayek this combination of issues saw
            Soviet-style central planning as <em>The Road to Serfdom</em> (1944): that central control of data and
            planning was innately authoritarian and contrary to the rights and freedoms of individuals. We know that
            this understanding is not specific to mid 20th century so-called socialist planning: in the digital era
            there is a clear record of social media companies&mdash;including the largest global companies in the
            world&mdash;mining personal data and manipulating both individuals and political processes.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u188" class="unit available">
        <p>Conversely, Posner and Weyl (2018), in what they take to be the spirit of Hayek, advocate that individuals
            should own and trade their own data. From our perspective, people’s ownership of their own data is
            fundamental, but the Posner and Weyl proposal is at most a second best alternative. Individuals may receive
            a fee for their data, but will then lose control over how those data are used once sold. It does not address
            the loss of control; it simply prices it.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u189" class="unit available">
        <p>Our preferred position, embedded in the protocol design of the new economic space, is that individual data
            are considered the property of individuals, but it is also recognized that pooled data are critical to
            identifying the health and dynamism of the network.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u190" class="unit available">
        <p>Instead of an individual data market, the new economic space proposes a data commons: individual agents can
            choose whether, and to what degree, to share their data with the commons, and in return acquire access
            (according to the degree of sharing) to the aggregate data of the commons. The protocols of the commons are
            considered in Chapter&nbsp;6. In the current context, we note simply that mutual staking of a commons
            enables a distributed but shared position on economic design,<sup class="footNote" id="fn66">66</sup>

        <p>To build the conditions for a distributed postcapitalist economy it is clear that markets are integral: they
            are an essential source of information in a scalable, non-centralized system. But should an analysis of
            postcapitalism start with markets?<sup class="footNote" id="fn67">67</sup> In Chapter&nbsp;1 we contended
            that the Economic Space Protocol is centered on postcapitalist performances and the creation of
            collectively-defined meanings of value. Yet we are starting our exposition of this Protocol not with
            performances of new value creation but with processes of market exchange. This is not a matter of choice: it
            is the engineering foundation on which communication protocols must be built.</p>

    <div id="u194" class="unit available">
        <p>We share this entry point with Marx, in Volume 1 of <em>Capital</em> (1867), who starts by establishing the
            principles of equivalence in exchange, denominated in units of labor time&mdash;what he calls ‘simple
            exchange’&mdash;before he turns to the production of new value. Like Marx, we later return to exchange in a
            central role; now within the dynamics of an economy of investing and credit issuance (Chapter&nbsp;9). Some,
            including supporters of Marxism, would say that this starting point is fraught with problems,<sup
                class="footNote" id="fn68">68</sup> for building the dynamism and uncertainty of performances on top of
            a protocol of simple exchange is challenging. Performances and exchanges have different drivers: they are
            not an automatic fit. But it is where we start, and we must approach it knowingly, including appreciating
            the challenges it created for Marx.<sup class="footNote" id="fn69">69</sup></p>

        <p>In particular, it is important to recognize that the analysis in this chapter assumes a liquid market: that
            there are no impediments to transactions due to a lack of capacity to ‘buy’ (match an offer). This is a
            simplifying assumption to ‘get the analysis rolling.’ In Chapter&nbsp;8 we return to issues of liquidity, in
            the context of bringing network credit into the analysis.</p>

    <div id="u196" class="unit available">
        <p>A challenge of starting with simple market exchange is that everyone thinks they know how exchange works, so
            our propositions will be read as just an idiosyncratic restatement of a familiar process. But this chapter
            is much more than a semantic re-framing of conventional depictions of markets: the explanation below opens
            up one face of the distinctive dynamics of the Economic Space Protocol. Just as exchange is different in
            gift societies from capitalist societies, so it is different in the new economic space. In this chapter, we
            address how market interactions have to be designed in order to be non-capitalist, scalable, with unique
            units of account and not centrally managed.</p>

        <p>Here is a brief summary, with each word needing respecification in italics. Those who participate in
            <em>markets</em> are <em>agents</em> who interact in a <em>network</em> and, through their interactions,
            create <em>economic space</em>. In these markets, <em>prices</em> are disconnected from the presumption of
            pursuit of profit and instead express units of collectively-defined <em>network value</em> (see <a
                href="#13.2-Network-value">Chapter&nbsp;13.2</a>). Transactions are confirmed by the transfer of
            <em>tokens</em> on a network <em>ledger</em>, rather than exchanges of ‘money.’</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u198" class="unit available">
        <p>One particular condition is elevated by this reframing. It is critical to dissociate collectively defined
            value from sales and hence expenditure/ revenue from sales. The new economic space must be able to attribute
            value to outputs produced for the commons, and those who produce collectively defined value for the commons
            must be able to receive a yield on their performance (as the condition of their reproduction). This means a
            network attribution of value for outputs that do not ‘go to market.’</p>

        <p>Most introductions to economics depict ‘individuals’ interacting as buyers and sellers in predominantly
            monetized markets. The Economic Space Protocol depicts ‘agents’ in tokenized markets. What’s the difference?
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="u201" class="unit available">
        <h3 id="agents">Agents</h3>
        <p>An economic agent is a networking unit with a unique network identity, following a protocol that may be
            utilized by an individual person or a collection of individuals. An agent is defined by reference to
            membership of a network, and the rights they gain from and give to such a network much the way a ‘citizen’
            is defined by reference to membership of a polity.<sup class="footNote" id="fn70">70</sup> Through an agent,
            individuals can collectively relate in ways of their own design (the agent can be itself a network), but
            when the agent relates to the larger network of which it is one part (a network of networks), it does so
            with a singular identity and with the capacities of a single economic agent. The network in aggregate is
            therefore always a network of networks.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u202" class="unit available">
        <p>Agents relate to the network via the creation and matching of offers, in basically the way individuals or
            firms in on-line markets for goods and labor tasks make offers. In the network language, the seller makes an
            offer and the buyer matches the offer. The word ‘match’ rather than ‘accept’ relates to the network process
            of pairing the two sides of an exchange transaction.<sup class="footNote" id="fn71">71</sup> The purpose may
            be a one-off transaction but of more interest is the potential for on-going relations: to engage with other
            agents in <em>mutual value creation, mutual investing</em> and <em>mutual provision of liquidity</em>: the
            three domains that define the postcapitalist token system we are designing. What distinguishes an agent in
            capitalism from one in a postcapitalist economy is the protocols by which they interact in a network.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u203" class="unit available">
        <h3 id="markets">Markets<sup class="footNote" id="fn72">72</sup></h3>
        <p>The Economic Space Protocol starts with the social as a design object, and is modeled after a network: it
            specifies the terms and rules by which agents participate in ‘the social’ as coherent, networked behaviors.
            The issuance and matching of offers to a network&mdash;the social relations between agents through the
            network&mdash;are, in the first instance, exchange relations and in this sense constitute a market. But they
            are also communication relations and in this sense constitute an economic messaging network. The generic
            exchange relations are defined in the protocols of commodity,<sup class="footNote" id="fn73">73</sup>
            credit, and stake exchange. The generic communication relations defined in the protocol are messaging about
            what is produced, what is collectively accepted as clearing the credit, and collective investment
            intentions. These exchange messages are elaborated in Chapter&nbsp;9.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u204" class="unit available">
        <p>For a network, market relations are effective for scaling, distribution and interoperability, but agents may
            also engage in ‘subnetwork’ interactions that may not rely on markets. These may be ‘local’ and directly
            co-operative, and these relations could involve quite innovative financial contracts (such as a gift;
            ownership which decays to the commons, etc.). These are all design questions. But to scale beyond the local,
            and be quantifiably recognized by the network-at-large, there must be the adoption of the larger network’s
            units of account.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u205" class="unit available">
        <p>These relations are not conceived around conventionally-defined market ‘structures’ of competitive,
            monopolistic, etc.; nor are they conceived around means-ends strategies of agents understood as optimizing
            individuals. Rather, these relations are conceived around performances: creative, often cooperative, but
            always social, acts that embed the potential for future effects and future rewards for the performers.</p>

    </div>
    <div id="u207" class="unit available">
        <p>Every economic space shares a common economic grammar or value calculus. Each individual economic space is a
            communication medium, where economic agents express, through offers and matching, participation in the
            pursuit of a shared network goal. The focus, therefore, is on shared knowledge or ‘expression’ which, in
            turn, can be used to continually redesign economic space, making it inherently adaptive in expressing what
            is valued.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u208" class="unit available">
        <p>Framed this way, an economic space is expressed in two dimensions: first in market exchanges (the creation
            and matching of offers), but noting that the interactions of exchange may not be motivated by either prices
            nor optimisation strategies; and secondly through performances, where agents take a position on their own
            and other agent’s proposals for future value creation. The focus here is an inter-temporal spread featuring
            risk, volatility and creativity. In performances it is these dimensions that animate the creation and
            matching of offers.</p>

    </div>
    <div id="u210" class="unit available">
        <h3 id="ledgers">Ledgers</h3>
        <p>Ledgers take the form of a digital double entry database; in structure basically no different from a
            corporate ledger. What will be different is the categories in which ledgers are compiled and the conditions
            for the entry of quantities against those numbers (the questions of what counts and how it is counted).
            These will depend on the network’s unit of exchange.<sup class="footNote" id="fn74">74</sup> The network’s
            ledger records multiple instruments/asset types represented in multiple accounts measured in terms of a
            shared unit of exchange, and thereby made commensurable with any other.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u211" class="unit available">
        <p>A token system based on distributed ledgers does not require the function of single, universally recognized
            means of exchange, only that a means of exchange is quantitatively recognisable (has an exchange rate; is
            commensurable) across a network, where ownership and valuation can be recorded on a verifiable ledger. The
            reach of any token comes from the extent of a network of ledger relations. Moreover, there need be no
            presumption that the one token type performs all the ‘standard’ money functions. Different money functions
            can be implemented through different protocols, and different token types can be better or worse at
            them.<sup class="footNote" id="fn75">75</sup></p>
    </div>
    <div id="u212" class="unit available">
        <p>How agents share the data stored on the network ledger is a matter of protocol design. Individual agent data
            is defined as private, but aggregated data forms the basis of a data commons, in which individual agents may
            choose their degree of participation.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u213" class="unit available">
        <h3 id="tokens">Tokens</h3>
        <p>Tokens have many attributes, and those attributes are being introduced at different stages of the analysis.
            We first introduced tokens in a preliminary way in <a href="#1.4-A-note-on-terminology">Chapter&nbsp;1.4</a>
            and in Chapters&nbsp;9 and 10 they will be given full development. In the current context, we focus on their
            role in market exchange in the Economic Space Protocol.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u214" class="unit available">
        <p>Tokens are tickets that signal rights. Formally, fiat money is a subset of tokens<sup class="footNote"
                id="fn76">76</sup> and some crypto-tokens, most notably bitcoin, stand with fiat money as a
            centrally-issued (though distributedly verified) token system. In the Economic Space Protocol, tokens are
            bearer (smart) contracts, and can express a multitude of modes of instruction. For example, some tokens are
            more akin to entry tickets (to a bus, concert, etc.) which have a particular use: they are issued by agents
            and once they have been used, they cannot be reused. Others may be used for clearing of credit, a process
            explained in Chapter&nbsp;8. Yet others may be utilized to receive a stream of dividends.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u215" class="unit available">
        <p>In the new economic space a token is an exclusive, quantifiable set of rights, whose transfer is recorded on
            and enforced through a ledger. The state of the token is always reflected in the accounting derived from the
            ledger. When an offer is made by one agent and matched by another (for example for exchange of a commodity),
            the receipt of the commodity triggers the issuance of a token by the agent who matched the offer; recording
            the completion of the transaction. So it is individual agents, not a central authority who issues tokens.
            Some tokens may be redeemed, and become inactive.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u216" class="unit available">
        <p>Immediately we see that these tokens are not what is popularly thought to be ‘money’ or ‘coins.’ They are
            neither being ‘minted’ (an operation applicable to ‘coins’; not to bearer contracts) or exclusively issued
            by privileged third parties (as applies with fiat currencies). Hence tokens are not, in themselves, a
            preferred or agreed upon store of value: a token must always attach to (stand for) a ‘real’ asset (encoded
            as a set of contractual rights). A more precise concept is ‘material underlier’ and there must be ‘real’
            asset transfers associated with token exchanges.<sup class="footNote" id="fn77">77</sup> For example, wealth
            may be stored as stake, and recorded by a token entry in the network ledger to that effect (an asset
            recorded in a ledger as X stake tokens).</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u217" class="unit available">
        <p>In the light of this clarification of tokens, an economic space, as defined in <a
                href="#3.3-Economic-space">Chapter&nbsp;3.3</a>, can be respecified as a network where every agent
            participates in the distribution of tokens, exchanging offers, and archiving those interactions on a
            verifiable record.</p>

    </div>
    <div id="u219" class="unit available">
        <p>In Chapter&nbsp;2 we developed a critique of the Hayekian focus on prices and the propensity to reduce all
            information to a single index. Our counter-proposal was the need to preserve the complexity of information,
            for it may well find new meaning (form into new performances and new outputs) over time.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u220" class="unit available">
        <p>In the Economic Space Protocol, an act of exchange registers a transfer of title (ownership), and that
            transfer will be recorded at a ‘price,’ in the sense that an object of ledger transfer is attributed a rate
            of exchange. Our analysis must describe the formation of that quantity, but for now we invoke the idea that
            an output finds validation (is attributed with value) in the network. The word ‘price’ is a word that has a
            popular meaning akin to the way it is used by Hayek, but it is a term we should not surrender to that
            specific meaning. To reclaim the word we introduce four different notions of ‘price’:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><em>A direct price</em>. This is a price determined in point-in-time exchange between the agent and
                    the network (ultimately another agent) for a quantum of tokens in an open market. This is somewhat
                    parallel to that found in Hayek, with the additional information dimensions.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><em>An indirect price</em>. This is a price that emerges on the network over time. This will be found
                    for outputs that find no direct price but become inputs into other outputs that do find a direct
                    price. Here is where the maintenance of a chain of information is critical. By following a chain of
                    output-becoming-inputs-becoming-outputs to a point where a direct price is found, the network can
                    retrospectively attribute a share of that direct price to formerly-unpriced inputs back down the
                    chain (see <a href="#Appendix-4.2">Appendix&nbsp;4.2</a>).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><em>A tribute.</em> Some right transfers will fit the category of a gift. These could be between
                    individual agents but, most critically for the Economic Space Protocol, these may be gifts to the
                    commons (see <a href="#6.3-Dividends-as-the-common-purpose">Chapter&nbsp;6.3</a>). The counter-gift
                    is access to the commons, on terms at the discretion of the commons.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><em>A synthetic price.</em> This is a price which can be created by the network to account for
                    outputs which are consumed collectively, most notably those given as tribute. The formula for a
                    synthetic price is (socially validated) costs of production + the average rate of return for the
                    network. Some outputs in the network can be said to produce value (they are socially valued) but
                    they are not designed to be sold. When the network wants to value these (for example in calculating
                    total output of the network) it may invoke a synthetic price.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div id="u221" class="unit available">
        <p>Indirect prices, tributes and synthetic prices have no parallel in Hayek. They are the forms of price that

        <p>Economic relations can be thought of as hierarchical or distributed. Hierarchical relations may be
            centralized (at the top of the pyramid) or decentralized (pushed down the pyramid, for example to regions or

        <p>In relation to ‘money,’ centralized money issuance and centralized clearing divides agents in the network in

        <p>Centralized architectures are optimal for mediums that propagate and process information slowly, and hence

            back-propagate it, becomes increasingly slow as the network grows. High speed communications and information
            processing media make centralized networking architecture obsolete. It is now possible to distribute to

        <p>Just as the engineering requirements of a network mean starting the analysis with exchange, so there is the
            requirement of starting with individual agents. The Economic Space Protocol designs the infrastructure
            through which these agents express their sociality but without a central agent imposing specific social
            goals. These are process-oriented protocols; not an ends-means system.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u230" class="unit available">
        <p>The Economic Space Protocol is designed to endow individual agents with a diversity of goals and provide them
            with capacity to generate a range of modes of measurement of their performances. Agents can pursue goals of
            their own choosing and measure in ways of their own choosing, but the value proposition of the network means
            that their success in achieving those goals must be validated by other agents. Sociability is therefore
            centered on addressing the question of ‘what constitutes network ’value,’ and how are the rewards for value
            creation shared across the network?</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u231" class="unit available">
        <p>The dynamic of agents pursuing their own economic vision, but needing to reconcile that vision with
            collective valuation, is what drives the network. As visions change, and as collective valuation changes,
            the system embeds a volatility of social expression. In this context, volatility isn’t something to fear or
            eradicate: it is the expression of social development, and opens the space for financial representation of
            evolving social goals (volatility as a financial spread).</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u232" class="unit available">
        <p>The protocols of the relationship between the individual agent and the system of collective valuation is
            therefore key to the economic expression of sociability. Posed in simple terms, to be elaborated in later
            chapters, agents ‘invest’ in their goals, emotionally, politically and financially, by the performances they
            choose to undertake and by staking the performances of other agents they believe contribute social value.
            Investing agents not only diversify their stake holdings (sharing risk) but, with a liquid stake market,
            staking becomes the network’s mode of voting on values see (<a
                href="#5.2-The-circular-logic-of-reciprocal-staking">Chapter&nbsp;5.2</a>). The on-going preparedness of
            agents to <em>keep</em> staking performances with certain value profiles then starts to define the network’s
            on-going depiction of value.</p>

        <p>The Economic Space Protocol starts with the network as a construct-in-itself: a set of protocols that must be
            followed by every individual agent who joins the network. It cannot be simply ‘assumed-to-exist,’ nor does
            it implicitly take on the social order in which it operates, for social relations are a design choice and
            agents explicitly must agree to the protocols. But ‘the social’ cannot be expressed simply as the sum of
            those individual interactions: it exists at a different level of sociality.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u234" class="unit available">
        <p>This framing is critical to the new economic space, and warrants brief reflection. The analytical foundation
            of protocol design is generally individual agents who interact. Protocol design involves the building out of
            these interactions. But if we think of an economy as a whole, it is more than the sum of these interactions:
            It is not just a distinction of scale, but also of design too.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u235" class="unit available">
        <p>There are three critical factors here that are central to understanding <em>the network premium</em>,
            i.e. that the whole as more than simply the sum of individual interactions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><em>The Commons.</em> There is a need to identify, preserve and expand performances that make
                    collective contributions that are not readily divisible to individual ownership. Protocol design can
                    generate a systematic expansion of the Commons (see Chapter&nbsp;6).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><em>Valuing collective performances.</em> Some outputs won’t be sold, even though they may give
                    social benefit. In a system centered on profit, that means they cannot be counted. But with diverse
                    modes of measuring, selling is not the condition of creating new value.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><em>Network performances</em>. The new economic space is a network of interactions between
                    subnetworks. Each of these subnetworks, and the aggregate network, can be seen as expressing
                    distinct performances in their own right. That is, they are not merely the aggregation of agent
                    performances inside ‘their’ network: they have distinctive meaning in combination. The overall
                    performance of the new economic space, accordingly, has a meaning that is more than just adding up
                    the individual parts. In particular, the overall performance will reveal the health of the network,
                    partly by reference to data on the mechanics of the protocol and partly as a measure of the success
                    of the network in meeting its (diverse) goals.</p>

        <h5>3.8 Governance</h5>
    </div>
    <div id="u237" class="unit available">
        <p>The Economic Space Protocol constitutes a process of governance through the design of markets and the rights
            of all individual agents in relation to those markets and hence to other agents. As we clarify these rights
            in specific applications to the Economic Space Protocol it will become apparent that they lie behind the
            logic of token issuance (and clearance): rights to issue, create, share and stake in performances, create
            and receive credit, or exchange commodities.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u238" class="unit available">
        <p>But the new economy, indeed any economy, needs means to set a collective social agenda; to determine what is
            valuable is to set priorities which will drive market incentives. This agenda <em>could</em> be set by
            decree from a central authority, or it could be set in a distributed way by markets designed so as to elicit
            support for possible social agendas. This would make governance of the network the role of all participating
            agents.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u239" class="unit available">
        <p>Distributed governance is also critical within production processes, or ‘performances’ as we call them (see
            Chapter&nbsp;4). Each act of valuation/ realignment is a form of decision-making. Unlike voting, which seeks
            to define a collective making a decision on what to perform, a performance is itself a decision seeking a
            collective to affirm it. Moreover, valuing performances follows market dynamics. It does not require
            creating a higher-powered agent like a board that coalesces preferences into discrete events and chooses a
            majority over a minority. Instead, distributed governance integrates opinions, preferences, and agendas by
            mutually empowering participants.<sup class="footNote" id="fn79">79</sup></p>
    </div>
    <div id="u240" class="unit available">
        <p>In distributed governance, and in the absence of a state as the source of trust in economic processes and
            institutions, trust must be founded within the network. There are four primary dimensions of this trust:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>trust in the integrity of the network.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>trust in the measurement device.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>trust in the quality and authenticity of what is being measured.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>trust in the counterparty (their risk of non-delivery or default).</p>

        </ul>
    </div>
    <div id="u241" class="unit available">
        <p>In the new economic space, trust in the network depends on trust in the protocol plus trust in participants
            in the network. The recording of transactions on a distributed ledger, where both seller and buyer confirm
            completion shifts issues of trust towards the protocol level to ensure that computation is correct,
            distributed state is consistent, and information is secure, to avoid issues like the ‘double spend.’ Knowing
            an agent’s transaction histories adds the dimension of a reputation rating for other agents.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u242" class="unit available">
        <p>Trust in measurement devices and the quality of measurement is the subject of token design, addressed in
            Chapter&nbsp;11. The critical issues here are the clear connection of token relations to economic relations,
            giving tokens a material basis in ‘real,’ and sustainable economic relations of investing (staking), credit

        <p>This chapter has introduced the core categories of the Economic Space Protocol, and has been designed to meet
            some specific challenges set out at the start of the chapter.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u245" class="unit available">
        <p>The consideration of markets in the context of new ways of measuring opens the possibility that things
            currently deemed desirable but unprofitable&mdash;for example care, art, research, affect, biosphere
            enhancement&mdash;can come to prominence as value-creating activities. They need not be seen as
            after-thoughts, to be ‘subsidized’ by the state or private philanthropists because they are
            virtuous-but-unprofitable.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u246" class="unit available">
        <p>The distributed nature of economic spaces focuses on the capacities of individual agents to pursue their own
            goals of value creation, to make offers to the network, to issue tokens, to reciprocally stake and, as we
            will see in later chapters, to issue credit. But the Economic Space Protocol is always drawing these
            individual agendas back to their social meanings and collective validation. This is framed not as a
            constraint on individual expression but as the condition for sociability; indeed, the condition for having a
            sense of the collective social agenda (network health, the commons, etc.) that is beyond the capacity of
            agents conceived as just an aggregation of individuals, to achieve.</p>

    <div id="u250" class="unit available">
        <p>Chapter&nbsp;3 presents the conceptual categories of exchange that serve as the foundation of performances.
            This chapter outlines the general nature of performances. It links closely with the following chapter on
            stake, which engages the way in which performances are valued by the network.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u251" class="unit available">
        <p>Performances must also be understood as protocols of a network. This is a process of recognising performances
            as a sequence of events, making them both composable and divisible, so that they can be encoded (see <a
                href="#4.3-Protocols-of-performances">Chapter&nbsp;4.3</a>). They are also interactive: across the
            network, they must be perceived, communicated and enacted. So each performance always includes an offer to
            the network, describing its organization, proposed outputs, proposed outcomes of those outputs, how their
            value should be measured, token issuance, governance, surplus distribution, etc.. Performances thus have
            scripts&mdash;to ‘perform’ the sequence of events&mdash;and are to be understood as expressions to be
            evaluated by the network.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u252" class="unit available">
        <p>A performance is akin to what economics calls ‘production,’ but we utilize the broader term for the following
            reasons:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>‘Performance’ puts the emphasis on creativity and innovation of those performing, unlike ‘production’
                    which is often associated with the repetitive discipline of a production line.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>How a performance is designed and implemented is determined by the performers, unlike production
                    which is often associated with hierarchical control.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>A performance has an audience; production has a market. An audience may pay directly to
                    consume/participate, but it may not. Part of the innovation of the new economic space is the
                    recognition that contributions to value can take multiple forms: they won’t all be expressed through
                    direct exchange in a market.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>It follows that there must be mechanisms of social (audience) acknowledgment and verification that
                    value is being created. The returns to performers that come from a social acknowledgment of value
                    creation are determined by relations of staking between agents, not extractive relations of wage
                    labor and capital.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div id="u253" class="unit available">
        <p>So performances express what makes a postcapitalist economy a different experience for those participating in
            it: it places their creativity and their intention to create social meaning at the center of the economy and
            scripts them as offers to the network. It is then up to the network to determine whether these proposals
            warrant support by staking. Here is where the diversity of values, and different modes of measuring value,
            take on practical meaning, both in agents’ decisions about what to produce and how to produce it, but also
            in their claims to create value for the network.</p>

    <div id="u255" class="unit available">
        <p>In the Hayekian (and neoclassical) framing of markets, there is no analysis of the process of production of
            outputs. There are inputs of labor, materials and technology, all acquired by exchange, and there are
            outputs sold for money. So there is an account for what goes into production and what comes out, but what
            goes on inside the production process is unexplained. Marx was decisively different in this regard. Marx
            depicts the relations in the process of production as the defining feature of a capitalist economy. It is
            the domain of the owners of the means of production (the employer of labor). The workplace runs at their
            discretion and wage workers must comply, subject to some degree of legally-imposed standards. These are the
            social relations Marx depicted as extractive: where workers produce more net output value than their wages
            can purchase. They produce a surplus, belonging to the owner.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u256" class="unit available">
        <p>In a postcapitalist economy we need a different analysis of the organization of performances. The
            contemporary literature on postcapitalism focuses heavily on democratic workplace relations, flat
            hierarchies and workers’ control over production decisions. In the light of the disturbing histories of 20th
            century centrally-controlled ‘socialist’ states, current proposals for postcapitalist priorities tend to
            gravitate to the virtue of direct p2p, community modes of organization, most of which are not designed to
            scale.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u257" class="unit available">
        <p>The protocols of the new economic space remain silent on the social relations of each performance. There are
            no standards or norms about how each performance may be defined and executed, how decisions are made, what
            metrics get generated and how performance revenues are shared between internal participants. In a
            distributed system it is the performance participants<sup class="footNote" id="fn80">80</sup> who must
            determine the social relations of that performance and associated governance structure. However, although
            those ‘performing relations’ are determined by participants, they are nonetheless subject to network
            scrutiny. Performing relations are themselves a performance offer to the network, and subject to network
            evaluation in the same way other performance proposals are subject to network evaluation. We might
            anticipate that the social relations of a performance will be a critical issue for prospective stakers (and
            stakers of stakers). These relations can, thereby, be a site of continuing improvement, for that improvement
            is itself a claim to value creation.</p>

    </div>
    <div id="u259" class="unit available">
        <p>A performance is the organization of a coherent set of actions across a network to achieve a stated goal as a
            network state change. It must be recognized by agents in the network as constituting a discrete series of
            events. Socially and culturally, a performance offer is an expression of an intention to create something of
            social worth and have it recognized and verified by the network; in effect, to be declared as value.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u260" class="unit available">
        <p>The term ‘recognition’ is important here, and it must have a formal meaning, for while a performance may be
            depicted as a creative, expressive offer, it must also be ledger-compatible. As defined by the International
            Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS Foundation 2015:12) ‘recognition is the process of capturing an asset or
            liability for inclusion in the financial statements.’ So it links closely to the chosen units in which a
            financial account is compiled and presented (see Chapter&nbsp;7). Suffice it here to say that recognition
            relates to the way a creative offer is expressed to the network in a way the network will recognise as a
            proposal to create a new asset.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u261" class="unit available">
        <p>Financially, a performance implies taking on a risk position on the future: a calculation that the costs of
            mounting a performance will generate new value in excess of those costs (a surplus in some form).
            Performances will generally be intentionally planned, but it is possible that network data may reveal the
            conditions of an ‘unplanned’ performance.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u262" class="unit available">
        <p>Performances may be ‘closed’ or ‘open’ (or have recognizable dimensions of each), reflecting distinctive risk
            positions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><em>A closed performance.</em> This is a pre-scripted process with a determinate end. It may be
                    thought of as a one-off or a defined series. The quantification of outputs here is relatively
                    straightforward and the risk is associated with the costs relative to Value creation of a
                    broadly-known output.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><em>An open performance.</em> Where the stated goal is aspirational and the performance may not have
                    a clear beginning, nor a clear end, it is called an open-ended performance. Its outputs are likely
                    to be inputs for ‘higher-order’ performances, just as its own inputs will likely be combinations of
                    other, ‘lower-order’ performances. The implied complexity and coordination makes the pricing of
                    outputs and of stake more about broader, collective, network goals than individual ones (see <a
                        href="#Appendix-4.2">Appendix&nbsp;4.2</a>). It is likely that performances offered to the
                    commons will be open rather than closed performances.</p>

                    devoid of a causal proposition over time. But when we propose causality (a+b leads to c), we invoke
                    the conditions for a performance. Events in combinations may then be treated as higher-order events
                    themselves. When data are encoded as narratives, they adopt the grammar of value, but still lack the
                    verification of the network that is the condition of value.</p>

                    <em>were to</em> lead to c&mdash;we add a contingency, for a+b may or may not lead to c. The
                    subjunctive proposition becomes a risk exposure when the occurrence of c has consequences which can
                    be expressed financially. This is a performance in the domain of taking a position on the future: a

                    formula). It has a magnitude that is expected to change over time. It also has a type, which is the
                    particular dimension of quantifiable measurement (e.g. transaction speed, liquidity index, average
                    transaction volume, carbon footprint, engagement index) that makes all performances commensurable in
                    these dimensions.</p>

                <p><em>A measurement of value: network responses to a performance.</em> This involves the identification
                    of whether a performance has met its verifiable outcome targets (measures of social effects)
                    sufficient to be validated by the network as the creation of value. No measure can be made until the
                    completion of a first performance, but this measurement serves as information for staking on second
                    and subsequent performances.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><em>Stake: network calculation of future performances.</em> This results from the preparedness to
                    invest in some ownership of a performance. Stake frames contingency as potentiality. It takes the
                    contractual form: ‘I am prepared to stake an asset in expectation of a yield, should future events
                    occur.’ All the above data can impact decisions to stake a performance, but most obviously the
                    performance index and the measurement of value.</p>

            the codification of data into performances whose contingency can be staked. A critical proposition follows.

        <p>Any agent can transform information into an index or ‘measure’ and publish it to the market, but whether it
            becomes network-recognized will depend on others adopting it to measure their activities consistent with its
            meaning. An index or other measure must be endorsed by the network and in this sense, indices have
            attributes of produced commodities: they are themselves ‘performed.’</p>

        <p>These measure performances of technical processes of output creation. They are the mode of measuring
            (counting) outputs of a performance. Quantification is critical in any economy, but in the Economic Space
            Protocol these quantities are not immediately or always converted to a universal unit of exchange (prices
            and revenues). The compilation of indices must preserve how output and outcome qualities are
            different-but-measurable.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u268" class="unit available">
        <p>Performance indexes measure combinations of data that seek to capture statistical relations designed to
            depict events, using nominated measures such as repetitions, influence, replications and attraction. A
            performance could be a single event-with-consequences (e.g. other performances reference/adopt/adapt this
            performance) or the event is itself repeated, with each repeat triggering recognition. Either way, it
            involves the identification and quantification of a continuous set of indicators, that are defined at the
            time the performance is offered for stake. Quantifying occurrences makes different outputs quantitatively
            commensurable (as a spread), without reducing them to a single measure. Notice that this framing preserves
            the diversity of measures to preclude them being reduced to a single index (which would then look like a
            conventional price). In summary, performance indices preserve what is qualitatively distinctive about
            outputs and outcomes while at the same time counting their occurrences (quantifying).</p>

        <p>These identify performances as expressive acts of productive creation, designed to produce value for the
            network. A performance starts as an agent making an offer to the network. That offer must specify how the
            performance will be undertaken, the outputs of the performance, and the intended social outcomes of those
            outputs It is on the basis of this offer&mdash;the proposed performance and its nominated mode of network
            recognition&mdash;that other agents in the network will decide whether, and to what extent, they will stake
            the performance. The mechanics of this process are developed in <a

                <p><em>The worth of the performance.</em> Is the performance recognized by the network as an expression

                    specified ‘indexification’ provide an effective measure of the performance goal? For example, for a
                    performance related to human care, the network will be determining whether the way care is defined
                    in an offer, how the provision of care is organized and managed, and the way units of care
                    performance are specified (e.g. recipient responses; physical wellbeing of the recipient, etc.) are
                    considered stakeable, and at what stake price?</p>

        <h5>4.5 A ‘value theory of performance’</h5>
    </div>
    <div id="u272" class="unit available">
        <p>In our analysis we refer many times to ‘value,’ and do so not simply in an ethical sense of what is deemed
            desirable, but also in a technical economic sense of being a way of measuring. So what do we mean by this
            latter meaning of ‘value’? Broadly speaking, in economics there are two types of value theories.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u273" class="unit available">
        <p>One is based on ‘objective’ measures that sit outside of market prices. The most prevalent are labor theories
            of value of which Marx’s is the best known.<sup class="footNote" id="fn84">84</sup> Value in this approach
            is related to labor time embedded directly or indirectly in a produced commodity. What makes this a social
            theory is that all different sorts of labor are conceptually convertible to units of abstract labor: that
            which all acts of labor share in common. When we frame that as a relation to capital and production for
            profit, all labor stands collectively as the creators of output and capital collectively as the owners of
            the output.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u274" class="unit available">
        <p>The other type of value theory adopts ‘subjective’ measures that are focussed directly on the individual
            preferences of sellers and buyers and how they interact in a market, to exchange at a price. Broadly this
            covers neo-classical and Hayekian approaches. The social dimension here (which might constitute an approach
            to ‘value’) is the way that all individuals’ preferences combine to form prices that clear markets, in a
            process gravitating to equilibrium (neoclassical) or spontaneous order (Hayekian). The socialness is that as
            each agent changes their decision, it impacts on price, and hence on the decisions of every other agent.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u275" class="unit available">
        <p>Most adherents of this latter approach, however, would not generally describe themselves as ‘value
            theorists,’ for they recognize no domain of calculation other than price. Conversely, for those who adhere
            to ‘objective’ theories of value, price is real, but superficial: value defined in the realm of production
            is the long-term driver of markets, and prices are a response to short-term factors, but will tend to vary
            around longer-term (labor) values.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u276" class="unit available">
        <p>The Economic Space Protocol draws on both, but complies with neither of these theories of value.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u277" class="unit available">
        <p>Labor-based approaches to value were designed to explain the workings of capitalism, not the conditions for
            postcapitalism. Indeed, in the domain of social relations of performance defined by staking and innovation,
            it is social effects, not labor inputs that will be the key to value. For the Economic Space Protocol, value
            relates to the social recognition (staking) of the performance itself; not social recognition (purchase) of
            the outputs of performances. The difference is subtle, but significant.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u278" class="unit available">
        <p>Labor-based approaches struggle to deal with the ‘value’ of outputs where marginal costs are virtually zero.
            This problem was originally posed in this sort of value theory as the difficulty of putting a value on
            nature. Nature, being created without labor, could be treated as the exception. But today, intangible
            outputs like software, networks and knowledge are increasingly prevalent in the economy, but labor time in
            production seems to explain very little.<sup class="footNote" id="fn85">85</sup> Our depiction of
            performances associated with exchange is designed precisely to account for the collective contribution of
            intangibles in new, creative ways.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u279" class="unit available">
        <p>A subjective preference approach to value, conversely, faces no such challenge from intangibles, but price
            has to be framed around private patent ownership and contrived scarcity. Software markets reach a clearing
            price, but only by social exclusion (e.g. by restricting access; hiding the source code). So recognition of
            intangibles in this approach can only be achieved by a private, not an innately social, approach to value.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="u280" class="unit available">
        <p>A postcapitalist approach to value must encode ways to value the social that are not expressed via quantified
            labor, nor simply by output price. Indeed, there should be no suggestion that price and value are, or can be
            made, of the same quantities: a proposition that haunts Marxian value theory (the problem of ‘transforming’
            values defined in socially necessary labor time into (smoothed) prices). In our analysis, value comes from
            the attribution of social recognition, and we will later identify how this recognition might be measured,
            but these are not proxy prices. The ‘conversion’ from values to prices, if there is indeed such a process,
            is expressed through staking: how agents change their staking decisions in response to value measures, but
            it is a tendency only; not a formal connection. This is why we focus on the <em>performance as the mode of
                expression</em> of value. A performance may be initiated by an exchange in a market but, in contrast
            with subjective preference approaches, it is the social meaning that can be built around the exchange, not
            the exchange itself, that is critical to value creation. Moreover, and unlike ‘objective’ approaches to
            value, the goal is not to explain each commodity’s value in terms of output metrics, but to identify a
            network perspective on what outputs are deemed to create value for the network: how a producing population
            of agents creates, funds and maintains collective benefits for the network.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u281" class="unit available">
        <p>To achieve this focus, we must look at the social consequences of production and exchange. To say that an
            output is a social contribution, it is not sufficient to say that it sells for a price, nor that it was
            produced by labor for the market,<sup class="footNote" id="fn86">86</sup> but that it is validated by the
            protocols of the network (see <a href="#Appendix-4.1">Appendix&nbsp;4.1</a> and Chapter&nbsp;7).</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u282" class="unit available">
        <p>For this to be impactful on the growth of the economy, and on incentives for producing agents, there must be
            trailing commissions, yields or dividends attributable to performers and other owners of stake in the
            performance. This is why postcapitalism must link to stake: the skin in the game that holds the connection
            between initial production and collective benefit (or, indeed, cost).</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u283" class="unit available">
        <p>Performance is the mode of expression of value that runs through from an initiating act, triggered by
            exchange, to broader social consequences. We could, therefore, call this a ‘performance theory of value.’
            But, following Elson (1979) on Marx’s value theory, we prefer to depict it as a ‘<em>value theory of
                performance</em>.’ Our goal is not to use individual performances to explain value, but to use the
            social conditions of value to give meaning to individual performances.</p>

            measuring the same thing, how they relate together warrants explanation. That explanation requires other
            elements, such as staking (Chapter&nbsp;5) and so will be clarified in Chapter&nbsp;7 on postcapitalist
            modes of measurement. In the current context of performances, we can identify public policy initiatives,
            associated originally with the British (HM) Treasury, that address the measurement of social impacts in a
            way that directly parallel the processes we are invoking, and which have been critical in framing our

        <p>These are sometimes called social benefit bonds or pay-for-success bonds.<sup class="footNote"
                id="fn88">88</sup> They were first implemented by the British state in 2010 to fund social policy
            expenditures on experimental projects. These were initially programs to address prisoner recidivism and then
            programs for family reunification in the context of children taken into the state’s welfare system. Around
            the world, there have since been many other applications.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u288" class="unit available">
        <p>The critical innovation of social impact bonds is that they design a bond for a private investor to purchase,
            where the funds raised from the bond sale are spent on an experimental public policy intervention
            (i.e. where the outcome is unknown). The intervention must be undertaken by an ‘independent’ third party,
            not a party to the contract, to ensure the results are verifiable. The bet for the investor is whether the
            intervention will achieve a pre-specified level of success (if, for example, a group of prisoners that
            receives the intervention has 20% lower rate of recidivism than a control group). If the intervention is
            successful in achieving its 20% target, the investors get a payout; if not, they lose their money.<sup
                class="footNote" id="fn89">89</sup></p>
    </div>
    <div id="u289" class="unit available">
        <p>This innovation had two relevant features for our purpose. First, the design of social impact bonds embeds
            the criteria by which success (an investor payout) would be verified. This is not a policy of ‘intervene
            first and evaluate after’: the conditions of evaluation (the 20% improvement condition, for example) is
            known to the investor before they invest. In the depiction of performances presented in this chapter, this
            is an important feature: the performance offer must declare its claims to independently verifiable outcomes,
            and the probability of these targeted levels being achieved enters into investor calculation about staking
            the performance. In a social impact bond, independent verifiability is undertaken by a separate institution:
            neither the state nor the investor, but the third party commissioned to undertake the intervention. In the
            new economic space, it is believed that network-generated data will be the primary source of independent
            verification. However, an agent could offer the performance of verification services to the network.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u290" class="unit available">
        <p>Second, the design of social impact bonds enables the quantification of social phenomena generally thought
            unmeasurable. It measures not an absolute outcome (what number (to appear on a ledger) could be given to a
            successful recidivism reduction program, and what is the measure of ‘success’?) but the spread between the
            intervention group and the control group (was there a 20 percent difference?). This spread is the objective
            of calculation. If the intervention achieves a 20 percent spread, the intervention is deemed successful and
            the investor gets an agreed bond payout; if not, the investors lose their money.<sup class="footNote"
                id="fn90">90</sup> This closes the intervention: the investor has received payment (or not) and the
            state has discovered whether the intervention is worth permanent funding (or not).</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u291" class="unit available">
        <p>The lesson for the new economic space is that measurement of performance outcomes, as the condition for
            declaring value, will be found in the design and pricing of spreads. This is a framing in the logic of
            financial derivatives: pricing the spread on the performance of an asset rather than pricing the value of
            the underlying asset itself. The financial derivative framing is developed in <a

            adopted and adapted by many states’ treasuries as the foundation for their policy evaluation frameworks. In

            features that are germane to the new economy space and the Economic Space Protocol. First, as with social
            impact bonds, the <em>Magenta Book</em> proposes knowing the method of evaluation before the policy
            commences; indeed designing the policy <em>so as to be</em> measurable. Second, it advocates drawing a
            difference between outputs and outcomes. Outputs are generally easy to quantify: number of reports or
            recommendations, surveys conducted, dollars spent, tonnes of this; hours of that, etc.. But outputs are not
            ends in themselves. It is on outcomes that policy aspires to exert an impact, and outcomes have to be

            technical point of comparison like transaction speed and volumes. But these are not the point of access to a
            determination of an individual value and the commensuration of different values. What the <em>Magenta
                Book</em> emphasizes in a policy context is that the critical task is to measure the <em>outcomes</em>
            of outputs. In the new economic space, the measure of outcomes is the equivalent to the process by which the
            network attributes value to the outputs of a performance. It is asking the question of whether a performance
            output led to the creation of something of value. Outcomes are the way in which the network will recognize
            (in the sense defined in <a href="#4.3-Protocols-of-performances">Chapter&nbsp;4.3</a>) a performance’s
            value. This reinforces the emphasis, in both social impact bonds and public policy design, that outcome
            measures are embedded in the design of performance offers.</p>

            includes reference to token types which will not be explained until Chapter&nbsp;10. Their inclusion here,

        <p>In each above case, a single commodity event occurs (i.e. the performances combine to produce one network
            unit of value). The production of output is defined by the various performance chains that link to produce a
            commodity.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u305" class="unit available">
        <p>The effect of being realized as a commodity valued by the network then triggers claims on that commodity
            valuation, and a flow of ‘revenue’ claims in the opposite direction. This occurs by the automated issuance
            of a commodity token for each recording of a commodity value event in the network. The commodity token is
            then distributed (into partial shares) back down the performance chain, so that each performance that feeds
            into a commodity claims a share of Value.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u306" class="unit available">
        <p>When an agent attributes values to a performance, it does so by ‘clearing’ or crediting the ‘performing
            agent.’ The effect is to validate an exchange of value by issuing a commodity token. For the owner of the
            performance, this crediting effectively enables them to settle credit, and as credit is held against stake,
            the net balance of stake increases. Critically, where ‘Value’ is being recognized in the network not as
            monetary return (sale for a price) but asset of performances validated by the network, then the ‘benefits’
            of successful performances are revealed not as monetary revenue, but as a reduction in outstanding
            liquidity: a wealth effect, not an income effect.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u307" class="unit available">
        <p>Hence, the value of the commodity token is that it is the means by which agents party to the chain of
            performances can clear credit (which has been issued against stake; see below). How those shares are divided
            is contractually determined at each link in the chain. When an individual ‘P’ is many links away from ‘C,’
            its share of the issued commodity token may be relatively small; conversely, an individual ‘P’ may form a
            link in many chains, and thus access a share of commodity tokens from many sources.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u308" class="unit available">
        <p>Further, commodities may combine with performances to create higher-level commodities as depicted in Figure
            4.4.</p>
        <figure>
            <img class="invertOnDark pcImgs" src="book/imgs/4.4_combined-performances.png" alt="Figure 4.4 Combined performances" />

        </figure>
        <p>Reading from right to left, realization of the value of C1 triggers the issuance of a commodity token and
            hence a counterflow of liquidity clearing revenue to the owners of P3in recognition of their contribution to
            commodity value. When the counterflow reaches C2, the direct benefits accrue to the owner of C2, though the
            network acknowledgment of the contribution to value of C2 also flows through to the P2 and P3 levels, for
            their indirect contribution to C1. Each ‘level’ of claim on the value of C1 is contractually negotiated with
            the level above. This emphasizes that the conversion of performances (or combinations of performances) into
            commodities may be seen as the end of a particular performance chain, but new chains may emerge out of
            commodities, creating more complex commodities. The relation between performances and commodities comes to
            depict a Leontief-style input-output model.</p>

        <h5>5.1 Introduction</h5>

    <div id="u311" class="unit available">
        <p>Reciprocal staking involves agents investing in the performances of others by relinquishing stake in
            themselves. But it is more than simply each agent acquiring a portfolio of assets with diversified risk.
            Staking is the way in which agents and the network as a whole commit to a future, by backing proposals to
            create new economic value. Without a pre-specified, external notion of value (e.g. by reference to profit)
            staking immediately opens an economic and social imaginary of what the priorities of that future could be,
            both individually and collectively. It gives the network a dynamic of growth, disruption and realignment,
            and the collective, exploratory choice of direction.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u312" class="unit available">
        <p>The process of agents in a network taking stake in each others’ performances could be subject to a range of
            economic and social interpretations. Is it a petit bourgeois (small business) stock exchange, with an
            extractive logic? So does it imply a logic of some agents devouring others and an inevitable polarization of
            wealth? If posed outside the Economic Space Protocol, this is a possible meaning.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u313" class="unit available">
        <p>In the context of the Economic Space Protocol, staking points in a different direction, although partial
            parallels with a capitalist stock exchange should be acknowledged, and the contrasts should be drawn to make
            the differences stark. (Terminologically, we use the word ‘stake’ in the Economic Space Protocol and ‘stock’
            in relation to the capitalist stock market.) Four key points of comparison feature prominently in this
            chapter.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u314" class="unit available">
        <p>First, unlike the stock market, the market for stake involves <em>reciprocal</em> investing. Agents enter the
            network not with a quantity of money with which to acquire stake in others, nor by offering themselves as
            wage workers (both of which would then play out an extractive logic of growing wealth inequality), but with
            proposals for performances or with propensity to participate in others' performances actively and/or
            financially. We see a shift towards what Marx called ‘free association’ and individual ‘self activity.’<sup
                class="footNote" id="fn92">92</sup> The role of the Commons in expressing this propensity towards
            postcapitalism, is explored in Chapter&nbsp;6.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u315" class="unit available">
        <p>Second, the criteria of performance success are different for stock and for stake. In broad terms, in
            capitalist countries, corporate governance legislation requires making profit to be a priority
            objective,<sup class="footNote" id="fn93">93</sup> with just a small amount of wriggle room to enable
            recognition of so-called social, environmental and governance input (so-called ESG accounting). In the new
            economic space, the goals of investors and performances are not pre-specified. We refer here not to the
            recognition that some investors may be altruistic, and not profit-driven, for that also happens in
            capitalism. Rather, the network’s goals are determined in distributed processes and subject to change
            according to the changing view of the network.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u316" class="unit available">
        <p>Third, stock and stake involve different risk allocations. New stake is created and issued as part of a
            mutual stakeholding transaction. In effect, each party to the transaction, and their respective networks,
            are underwriting each others’ issuance. As stake forms collateral for credit, the parties are also
            underwriting each others’ credit issuance. The intention, as with stock market equity, is to expand net
            value creation and hence the net value of stake itself. Although new stake issuance ‘dilutes’ the proportion
            of total stake held by extant stakeholders, it is associated with an expansion of the performance potential
            of the underlying assets. The new stake therefore opens a new risk (the expansion) but also a shared risk
            (the underwriting).</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u317" class="unit available">
        <p>Fourth, mutual stakeholding transactions are strategic and continual and they convey critical information to
            the rest of the network. Issued stake quantity, price and transaction data are essential feedback, for they
            signal network perceptions (current and anticipated future) of the value creation capacities of each
            performance. Those perceptions about network recognition can change. Agents may seek to realign their stake
            portfolios by acquiring more stake or they may partially or fully exit a staking relationship. This
            depiction may also describe the decision-making process of a hedge fund or venture capitalist, but mutual
            staking makes both the risks and the consequences of staking decisions markedly different.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u318" class="unit available">
        <p>Behind staking are acts of exchange: in transacting stake, there will be offers and matches recorded on a
            network ledger.<sup class="footNote" id="fn94">94</sup> It follows that we are starting to see the
            conditions for the emergence of tokens as representations of these transactions. However, the consideration
            of tokens in relation to staking will be delayed until the social relations of staking are explained. This
            analytical sequence means that, at this stage of the analysis, there is not yet an elaborated unit of
            exchange in the network (see [Chapters&nbsp;7.2] and 9), so staking, as considered in this chapter, involves
            the determination only of relative values (ratios or equivalences) and just a conceptual reach to how they
            might be made operational as absolute values.</p>

    </div>
    <div id="u320" class="unit available">
        <p>The four points of difference between postcapitalist staking and capitalist stock purchasing point to two
            leading questions of the new economic space: first, how do we understand the rates at which agents will
            acquire stake in others and give up stake in themselves; and second, if expected profit is not the calculus
            that motivates staking decisions, what is?</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u321" class="unit available">
        <h3 id="staking-ratios">Staking ratios</h3>
        <p>When agents acquire stake in others by giving up stake in themselves, a critical issue is the decision of how
            much each invests in the other. Reciprocal staking will not simply involve Agent A acquiring one unit of
            stake in each of B and C and Agent B one unit of stake in A and C, etc.. It is the <em>ratios of
                allocation</em> that prove critical: how much stake A must be given up in order to acquire a unit of
            stake in B may be different from how much A is ready to give up to acquire a unit of stake in C. What these
            ratios reveal is the network’s <em>relative</em> view of each agent’s past and expected performances: those
            with the highest ratio (who have received the largest amount in stake offers, relative to others, and whose
            stake price is rising) are deemed the greatest contributors to value creation (see <a
                href="#7.3-Postcapitalist-units-of-value">Chapter&nbsp;7.3</a> for the process). The higher your ratio,
            the more the rest of the network values your performance relative to other performances. Reciprocal staking
            is the determination of these ratios. The process by which these ratios appear as absolute numbers is not
            considered until <a href="#8.4-Network-recognition-of-credit-and-credit-settlement">Chapter&nbsp;8.4</a>,
            for credit and liquidity are key to this development.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u322" class="unit available">
        <p>Even though the differences in prices between the stake tokens of different agents are vital to the system’s
            functioning in the short and medium terms, as means of empowering agents proportionally to the perceived
            value of their performances, they may create imbalances in the long term. Therefore, depending on the nature
            of the performance, the economic space can introduce inequality mitigation policies. One such policy is
            stake decay: as the stake held by an agent increases as a determined rate or to a determined level, some
            part of that stake will start decaying into the network (other stakeholders or the commons), according to a
            function. Stake decay or other redistribution policies are a design choice for every economic space and
            something to be considered by agents when deciding to participate.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u323" class="unit available">
        <h3 id="decisions-to-stake-other-agents-performances">Decisions to stake other agents’ performances</h3>
        <p>Staking involves investing in the inter-temporal contingencies of individual performances and how they are
            valued by the network. We can think of it as a sequence of three questions faced by an agent considering
            proposing a performance of whether to match another agent’s staking offer:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>what they would like to see happen in the future.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>what they think is likely to happen in the future.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>how they value what happens in the future and the past.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div id="u324" class="unit available">
        <p>The first of these&mdash;what would be good to happen&mdash;is an <em>aspirational</em> perspective. It
            invokes an emotional response to investing. Agents seek to author performances and stake the performances of
            other agents to generate outputs they would like generated by the network: what they individually think
            creates ‘value.’</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u325" class="unit available">
        <p>The second&mdash;what is likely to happen&mdash;is a <em>predictive</em> perspective. It invokes a
            calculative response to investing. It involves each agent positioning their own aspirations of performance
            and staking in the context of expectations of the network as a whole. It invokes a competitive response to
            investing. Indeed, if this is where our analysis stops, staking would be no more than simply financially
            positioning on the mood of the market. It would, to invoke Keynes’ critique of stock markets, involve
            placing bets on what other people think will be successful. Keynes’ critique is considered directly in <a
                href="#Appendix-5.1">Appendix&nbsp;5.1</a></p>
    </div>
    <div id="u326" class="unit available">
        <p>The third&mdash;interpreting the network’s response to performances&mdash;is an <em>evaluative</em>
            perspective. It invokes a social response to investing (see <a
                href="#4.4-Performance-indices-and-value-measures">Chapter&nbsp;4.4</a> and <a
                href="#Appendix-4.1">Appendix&nbsp;4.1</a>). It reveals a network perspective on which performances end
            up creating value in the network.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u327" class="unit available">
        <p>This is not a sequence of decisions: each is being made and remade simultaneously, as depicted in Figure 5.1.
            In capitalism, aspirations may be no different from the new economy, but prediction is about popular opinion
            about profit and evaluation is dictated by the profit outcomes. In the new economic space, evaluation is not
            by a predetermined criterion; it is determined by the network. If evaluation is endogenous, then prediction
            has no singular goal, and hence aspirations can be more expressive. Similarly, if evaluation is a social
            process, it feeds into emotion, into individual decisions about what to offer to the network and hence also
            into predictions.</p>

        </figure>
    </div>
    <div id="u328" class="unit available">
        <p>Endogenous evaluation means that what a network does value can be a mediated expression of what the network
            aspires to value, so long as there is diversity in predictions. There will be diversity in predictions
            because agents are not only predicting which individual performances will be successful; they are
            simultaneously determining the criteria of success.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u329" class="unit available">
        <p>Most agents, including those pursuing their own explicit maximization strategies, will diversify their
            predictions because they cannot know in advance the criteria by which their predictions will be evaluated.
            This process will see agents mining network data seeking investment trends and network opinions. Data
            analysis will not converge on a single outcome, but it may well see convergence to a range of aspirations, a
            range of modes of verification (performance indices) and a range of criteria of value. How broad or narrow
            these ranges are will be played out by the network itself.</p>

        <h3 id="combined">Combined</h3>
        <p>Our consideration of staking ratios involved depicting staking as a voting process in the network: which
            agents are perceived to be popular to stake and which unpopular. The consideration of the feedback processes
            in agents’ staking decisions shows that staking is more than voting. To invoke the terms of Benjamin Graham
            (sometimes called the ‘Dean of Wall Street’ and the father figure of ‘value investing’) in discussing the
            stock market, in the short run this market is a voting machine&mdash;determining the network’s popular views
            about how each agent’s proposal to produce value compares with other agents’ proposals&mdash;but in the long
            run it is a weighing machine, evaluating the relative substance of each agent’s performances.<sup
                class="footNote" id="fn96">96</sup> The weighing mechanism is about collectively determining how much
            each performance contributes to the network’s creation of new value, and hence determining exactly what is
            meant by a quantity of value (for this particular network).</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u331" class="unit available">
        <p>How can a network measure the value of things even though there may be no single, ‘objective’ measure of
            value and, indeed, some output may never be sold for a price? The answer is that the willingness of agents
            to stake a performance shifts the focus away from how to get an exact, agreed definition of ‘care,’ or
            ‘environmental benefit,’ ‘artistic/ technological contribution’ etc., and towards the willingness of agents
            to stake a particular definition. The risk of staking is the likelihood of certain defined events of ‘care’
            etc. occurring.<sup class="footNote" id="fn97">97</sup> This shift is critical, for instead of claiming the
            capacity directly to value outputs-with-no-price we analytically ‘sidestep’ that problem, or approach it
            indirectly by valuing the performances that generate those outputs-with-no-price. Adopting a cost plus
            average return pricing model we can then determine an implied, approximate ‘price’ value for those outputs,
            but the critical goal is not to have a full set of output prices, but a full set of staking prices.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u332" class="unit available">
        <p>There is one more analytical link before that explanation is complete: why would someone stake a performance
            that produces outputs that have value but no market price and hence generates no revenue? The answer is
            clear, although we have to connect to issues addressed in Chapter&nbsp;8 to explain it. It is that when the
            network attributes a token to that value creation, the token can be used to clear credit in the network. It
            means that creditors, and creditors of creditors, are recognising the creation of value. The capacity to
            clear credit becomes the ultimate network-wide recognition of value creation.</p>

        <p>Agents will stake other agents’ performances not merely to express views about what constitutes value, but in
            search of a yield. This includes a yield on outputs that are consumed in the commons.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u335" class="unit available">
        <p>The returns to staking will be in whatever form the staking contract nominates, but generally they are in two
            forms. First, there are changes in stake price. The full meaning of this awaits the introduction of tokens,
            and especially the credit token. It also awaits a consideration of the relation between internal and
            external financial units (e.g. fiat).</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u336" class="unit available">
        <p>Second, stake will generate ‘a dividend’ (value-remuneration sharing). It may be a share of output, or a
            share of net revenue (outputs less the cost of inputs). It could be a financial return or a commodity output
            return, and those returns may accrue directly to the stakeholder or to some other agent nominated by the
            stakeholder, such as the commons (see Chapter&nbsp;6). It could also give other rights; for example, rights
            to influence the future evolution of the performance, or it could give the stakeholder rights to build their
            own performance in connection with the performance they staked. Indeed, when outputs are framed as
            dividends, dividends themselves become the center of the governance and innovation dynamism that drives the
            network. This depiction is central to the way ‘surplus’ is defined in the network.<sup class="footNote"

    <div id="u337" class="unit available">
        <p>Notice, therefore, the investor intent that now becomes apparent in the act of staking when we focus on
            returns to staking. Agents stake a performance that they would ‘like to see happen,’ because it complies
            with their emotional and aesthetic perspective, because they believe the performance is important in the
            overall profile of the network, or because there is a distinctive dividend they would like to acquire, be it
            a physical package, access to something or simply an acknowledgment that the performance they staked
            generated a benefit for others. This reveals that ethical, emotional and aesthetic dimensions are embedded
            in the depiction of value, and the dividends on performances will therefore also embed those ethical
            foundations.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><em>Resourcing performing</em>. Staking is a means by which agents enter the performance of another
                    agent: staking opens ‘relations of performing’ which are not premised on wage labor or other
                    extractive production relations.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><em>Diversifying risk</em>. Staking enables the initiator/undertaker of performances to share the
                    risks of their innovation, and mutual staking sees them diversify their own risks.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><em>Collateral.</em> Stake stands as collateral for credit. The price of stake (reflecting future
                    projections of its holders) therefore backs the credit that will fund other future performances.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><em>Social Pooling</em>. Stake not only enables the diversification of risks (which is indeed one
                    form of pooling); it also expresses the way in which individual agents who stake a performance
                    combine to form a new agent defined by their common purpose (a new economic space), and in turn the
                    way in which performances combine to form aggregated networks.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><em>Commensuration of performances.</em> Stake price makes all different performances commensurable,
                    and hence creates the idea of an economy of collective innovation and interoperability among
                    economic agents. But it does so, critically, without reducing the measurement of performances to a
                    single index: it intentionally preserves the importance of diverse ways of measuring the
                    value-creation of each performance.</p>

        <h5>Appendix&nbsp;5.1 Fundamental value and speculation: Keynes’ beauty contest</h5>
    </div>
    <div id="u341" class="unit available">
        <p>Keynes was critical of stock market speculation. He was writing in the context of the 1920s stock market boom
            and the 1929 crash which directly connected to the Great Depression of the 1930s. In his <em>General Theory
                of Employment, Interest and Money</em> (1936) he wrote of ‘the euthanasia of the rentier,’ referring not
            to a literal policy proposal but to the prediction that the lower interest rates he believed his policies
            would generate would mean that people could not live off the income stream of their assets. They would have
            to invest in ‘productive’ activities.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u342" class="unit available">
        <p>Keynes’ critique of stock markets was that investors simply buy the stocks they think other people will buy,
            for the more people who want to buy a stock, the more its price will rise. Popular investing, he contended,
            has nothing to do with the underlying business proposition and assets of companies (often called the
            ‘fundamentals’) and everything to do with what investors think other people will do; indeed, what investors
            think other people think other people will do. It is apparent that, more than 90 years on, there is
            widespread adherence to Keynes’ interpretation of the stock market, and especially its application to
            investors in volatile cryptoasset markets, where many tokens are made up of narratives that lack underlying
            assets (‘fundamentals’).</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u343" class="unit available">
        <p>We have differentiated staking in the new economic space from stock market investing in a capitalist economy,
            albeit accepting certain parallels, and from other forms of staking in cryptoeconomics.<sup class="footNote"
                id="fn99">99</sup> Nonetheless, does Keynes’ caution about stock speculation apply to our proposals for
            reciprocal staking, especially in the light of a 2022 major downturn in crypto markets? We need to be clear
            about how our proposal is distinct from Keynes’ dramatic critique.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u344" class="unit available">
        <p>Here is Keynes’ critique. (Readers are asked to overlook the almost 100-year-old social presumptions of both
            the object being described and the language used to describe it.)</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u345" class="unit available">
        <p>To identify the workings of investing in the stock market, Keynes used an analogy with a style of 1930s
            newspaper beauty contests in which readers were asked to choose the 6 prettiest faces from a page of 100
            photographs. The prize, reported Keynes (1936: 156), was:</p>
        <blockquote class='internalQuote'>
            <p>awarded to the competitor whose choice most nearly corresponds to the average preferences of the
                competitors as a whole; so that each competitor has to pick, not those faces which he himself finds
                prettiest, but those which he thinks likeliest to catch the fancy of the other competitors.</p>
        </blockquote>
    </div>
    <div id="u346" class="unit available">
        <p>It is important to note that the ‘competitors’ in Keynes’ explanation are not the 100 faces in the ‘contest,’
            but the readers/voters. The terms of the competition, Keynes continued, generated a distinctive voting
            logic:</p>
        <blockquote class='internalQuote'>
            <p>It is not a case of choosing those [faces] that, to the best of one’s judgment, are really the prettiest,
                nor even those that average opinion genuinely thinks the prettiest. We have reached the third degree
                where we devote our intelligences to anticipating what average opinion expects the average opinion to
                be. And there are some, I believe, who practise the fourth, fifth and higher degrees.</p>
        </blockquote>
    </div>
    <div id="u347" class="unit available">
        <p>In application to the stock market, Keynes contended that investors were like the reader/voters, buying
            shares not based on any criteria of fundamental value, nor propositions about profit-making potential, but
            on investors’ perception of what they think other investors will buy. So nothing matters but opinions, and
            opinions on opinions, or what they think other investors think others investors believe is the average
            opinion of the value of the asset. In other words, it’s all a speculative bubble of popular opinion without
            substance and it’s destined to burst.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u348" class="unit available">
        <p>Some readers may see a parallel between Keynes’ beauty contest analogy and our depiction of the relation
            between staking and network determination of value. But that would be a misunderstanding.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u349" class="unit available">
        <p>The first thing to note is that Keynes’s analogy in application to the stock market is itself limited. It
            mis-places the role of the central authority. It inserts a discrete ‘prize,’ funded by a central authority,
            as the motive for playing, and the awarding of the prize ends the game. In the stock market, people may
            invest in response to popular opinion and may be ‘ahead’ or ‘behind’ on their balance sheets according to
            stock choice and timing. But over time the material basis of share prices will be revealed by what
            state-certified corporate accounts actually show to be the profit performances of companies. The state’s
            role is not as a prize-giver to attract short-term audience participation but as a rule-maker to ensure
            reliable data.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u350" class="unit available">
        <p>Second, a direct analogy with our network proposal is flawed. In Keynes’ beauty contest, the contestants are
            not the faces (as would be implied by the term ‘beauty contest’) but the newspaper readers/voters. With
            reciprocal staking, the analogy would be if the only people who can vote in the beauty contest are the 100
            contestants; they can divide their votes into fractions, and there is no winner-takes-all ‘prize’: the prize
            is connectivity. So there is no ‘winning’ from voting for yourself and, directly or transitively, it is
            likely that everyone will be holding a partial vote for everyone else, so prizes are as much collective as
            individual.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u351" class="unit available">
        <p>If we think of the 100 people whose faces appear in the contest, each having their own ways of identifying
            facial attributes (their own measures of value), there will be built across the network not a speculative
            bubble but a system of facial recognition. Distributed determination of value is a system of network
            recognition of value.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u352" class="unit available">
        <p>Two years before Keynes’ <em>General Theory</em> was published, the idea of fundamental value rose to new
            prominence with developments in the analytics of corporate accounts. Benjamin Graham and David Dodd
            published <em>Security Analysis</em> (1934), introducing the concept of ‘value investing.’ Their work has
            been made famous in the 21st century by Warren Buffett.<sup class="footNote" id="fn100">100</sup></p>
    </div>
    <div id="u353" class="unit available">
        <p>The approach they took was to look at the intrinsic worth, or long-term ‘fundamentals,’ of a company and not
            be distracted by short-term share price volatility. The fundamentals include measures like company
            performance, profit margins, asset values, debt levels, etc.. The investment proposition was to use data on
            these fundamentals to reach an overall valuation of the company. This was then a guide to whether current
            stock prices were ‘overpriced’ or ‘underpriced,’ with direct implications as to whether the stock should be
            bought or sold at its current price.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u354" class="unit available">
        <p>Each of these fundamentals depicted by Graham and Dodd in 1934 is generally defined by reference to a
            distinctly capitalist economy and, we contend, an early to mid 20th century capitalist economy. In the 21st
            century, most of the largest and fastest growing companies in the world, when measured by market
            capitalization&mdash;such as Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Tesla&mdash;have share prices far in
            excess of what Graham and Dodd’s measures would recommend, and have done so for some time.<sup
                class="footNote" id="fn101">101</sup> To label these prices as ‘speculative’ and ‘bubbles,’ especially
            when they have lasted so long, seems to be a misreading of underlying processes.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u355" class="unit available">
        <p>We believe that these stocks are symptoms of a change in what we should understand by ‘intrinsic worth’ and
            ‘fundamentals.’ Two factors are critical here. One is that the intangible assets that dominate these
            companies’ balance sheets&mdash;software patents and brands&mdash;cannot easily be subject to Graham and
            Dodd’s measures.<sup class="footNote" id="fn102">102</sup> The second factor is that investors in these
            iconic 21st century companies are not simply speculators, nor are they simply ‘factoring in’ environmental,
            social and governance (ESG) qualifiers to their profit-driven calculus.<sup class="footNote"
                id="fn103">103</sup> Many are taking an intentional long-term position on the future of the economy and
            wider society. In a changing world, they are investing in intentional modes of change. They are signaling
            financially what they believe in and what they project the future economic frontiers to be. Neither Keynes’
            depiction of speculation nor Graham and Dodd’s depiction of intrinsic value appear able to capture this
            motivation.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u356" class="unit available">
        <p>For these reasons, we contend that stake and stake owners inside the network will not tend to behave the way
            Keynes described. But nor are the fundamentals the ones that Graham and Dodd described, for people’s social,
            political and emotional responses to network potential are themselves part of the fundamentals. Accordingly,
            the Economic Space Protocol provides the data required to construct measures related to affect in the
            network, and hence to undertake a fundamentals analysis informed by the critical role of affect. But it will
            be up to agents to compile these data in ways that generate meaning as well as prediction.</p>

        <h5>Appendix&nbsp;5.2 Dividends and the surplus</h5>
    </div>
    <div id="u358" class="unit available">
        <p>‘Surplus’ is one of those terms in economics with many meanings, and it is not appropriate that we should
            aspire to give the definitive meaning here. Nonetheless, it is a term we are using, and so it needs some
            clarification in the context in which it arises analytically.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u359" class="unit available">
        <p>In the financial language that frames our approach, a surplus is a spread. In neoclassical economics,
            focussed as it is on exchange relations, the surplus is in individual relations between buyers and sellers:
            it is the spread between the price a buyer/seller would have been willing to accept and the price at which
            they do accept an offer. In Marx, surplus value is a class-based spread between the value of labor power
            (approximately equal to the wage) and the new value created by current labor. Piero Sraffa’s (1960)
            adaptation of Marx, which has been an important underlying influence in our analysis, poses the surplus as
            the spread between the commodities used up in the process of production and the commodities created by the
            process of production. When we extend Sraffa from a commodity world to a financial world, the surplus is
            simply output values created that are not paid for. Non-payment is not about theft, but the capacity of
            human endeavor to create, such that inputs into production are not sufficient to account for the value of
            outputs.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u360" class="unit available">
        <p>The Sraffian depiction seems valuable because of its generality: the neo-classical depiction is simply about
            ‘bargains’ in trading&mdash;a depiction without useful social meaning&mdash;and Marx’s is specific to
            capitalist relations between labor and capital. The Sraffian surplus includes Marx’s surplus, albeit that
            the emphasis is not on extractive relations (i.e. that one class produces the surplus and another owns it)
            but its analytical benefit is that it can describe also a surplus in market-based, commodity producing
            societies that are precapitalist (late feudal) and a postcapitalist (a ‘market socialist’<sup
                class="footNote" id="fn104">104</sup>) economy. Sraffa’s ledgers resonate with those we describe in
            later chapters, and give us some tools to describe a postcapitalist surplus.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u361" class="unit available">
        <p>But Sraffa’s depiction also has an immediate limitation for our purpose, for it is explicitly a depiction of
            a surplus created in a non-monetary, commodity-producing economy (recall Sraffa’s major work is called
            <em>Production of Commodities by Means of Commodities</em>). If surplus is attributed to the human endeavor
            to create, then we should not presume that the creative outputs of that endeavor are only and always
            commodities produced for a market. We prefer the extended Sraffian conception of the surplus as ‘outputs not
            paid for,’ which gives us an open-ended framing of what constitutes an ‘output.’</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u362" class="unit available">
        <p>When our analysis opens up the conception of value in a postcapitalist economy we can also define the surplus
            as a spread. In the performance evaluation framework (see <a href="#Appendix-4.1">Appendix&nbsp;4.1</a>) the
            surplus is the spread between the value of network performance inputs and outputs, where outputs are valued
            by the network evaluation of the social outcomes they generate. In the derivative framing (<a
                href="#Appendix-5.2">Appendix&nbsp;5.2</a>) this spread is the value of the swap.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u363" class="unit available">
        <p>At this stage of the analysis we are now in a position to clarify (somewhat) the surplus of the new economic
            space. The surplus will take the form of dividends on stake, so it is appropriate to repeat the depiction of
            a dividend from <a href="#5.3-Returns-to-stakeholding">Chapter&nbsp;5.3</a>:</p>
        <blockquote class='internalQuote'>
            <p>It may be a share of output, or a share of the net revenue (outputs less the cost of inputs). It could be
                a financial return or a commodity output return, and those returns may accrue directly to the
                stakeholder or to some other agent nominated by the stakeholder, such as the commons (see
                Chapter&nbsp;6). It could also give other rights; for example, rights to influence the future evolution
                of the performance, or it could give the stakeholder rights to build their own performance in connection
                with the performance they staked.</p>
        </blockquote>
    </div>
    <div id="u364" class="unit available">
        <p>That list is open-ended: it can be whatever an agent’s performance specifies the intended dividend to be.
            Some part of these dividends are not surplus: they are the conditions of reproduction of the performances of
            stakeholders either directly (by being used as inputs in their performances) or indirectly, by being sold to
            enable the purchase of other inputs. Indeed, in the case of the commons, where outputs may be allocated for
            free, the existence of dividends may be significant for the stake price of the producer, and <em>that</em>
            is essential to the reproduction of the producer’s performance. We cannot, <em>ex ante</em>, specify what
            fraction is surplus and what is necessary for reproduction.</p>
    </div>

            Thesis 16 states:</p>
        <blockquote class='internalQuote'>
            <p>Marx’s definition of surplus-value hinges on the labor theory of value, according to which value is the
                quantity of labor-time that is ‘congealed’ in the product. Processual surplus value . . . is purely
                qualitative and concerns the intensity of lived potentials. It is surplus-value of life. Capitalist
                surplus-value and processual surplus-value are, of course, related, but they cannot be equated. The
                former is the systemic capture of the latter. Their difference—the difference between quality of
                activity as such and the derivation from it of a quantitative yield—is internalized by the system, to
                serve as its driving force. (2018: 16)</p>

                nothing more than how it was lived. It can be pursued on the smallest or most macro of scales, beginning
                from right where one is. No need to wait for the correct, final analysis (which will never come) before
                jumping in. No need for the end-all up front (which will never happen). Any and every moment can yield

        <p>The concept of surplus we are working with has some close parallel with what Massumi’s idea of processual
            surplus value is reaching for, because value is determined by the processes of the network. But for Massumi,
            it is critical that the surplus-value of life is unquantifiable. Thesis 5 states that:</p>
        <blockquote class='internalQuote'>
            <p>The first task of the revaluation of value is to uncouple value from quantification. Value must be

        <p>In simple terms, a commons entails resources that have shared ownership and are built and curated in a
            distributed way. Particularly in a digital era, all sorts of performances and outputs are commons
            compatible. Non-divisibility of outputs and (close to) zero marginal costs of production, as found in
            software and other digital goods, are all conditions for a commons.<sup class="footNote"
                id="fn105">105</sup> This suggests that commons attributes are everywhere: inside agents, between agents
            and across and between networks.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u373" class="unit available">
        <p>There is now an extensive literature on the ways in which p2p networks create the potential for a commons. We
            are strongly supportive of this broad agenda, and see a propensity towards participatory common ownership as
            integral to a postcapitalist vision.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u374" class="unit available">
        <p>We have already engaged issues that relate to the commons, but have not yet named them. One is reciprocal
            staking and the culture of risking together. Reciprocal staking is the mode of entry to the commons. The
            other is the exchange of particular commodities that have commons’ properties. Some outputs will be ‘public
            goods,’ defined as outputs where one person’s consumption does not preclude (indeed, may enhance) the
            consumption of others (for example data compiled by the network, public art, a clean environment). We
            believe that the second dimension is already well understood, and is not specific to the new economic space,
            so our focus is the commons that arises from mutual staking, or what we call the ‘synthetic commons.’ In
            finance the term ‘synthetic’ is used to describe instruments that are engineered to simulate the performance
            of other assets. In the Economic Space protocol, private ownership can, in certain circumstances, simulate
            the interests of collective ownership. <br>

        <p>Although a commons is conventionally defined as the antithesis of private property, reciprocal staking
            creates the conditions for a commons via private ownership. If all agents in the network are reciprocally
            staked with all other agents either directly or transitively<sup class="footNote" id="fn106">106</sup> then
            every agent is a partial owner of every other agent’s performances. It may not be a large proportion of
            stake in the first instance, but it is significantly greater than zero. These are the conditions in which
            private ownership exhibits the same interests as common ownership: a synthetic commons. It is as if
            reciprocal staking across the network cancels out the effects (interests) of private ownership, for when
            each agent benefits from the success of every other agent, individual interests converge with collective
            interests.</p>

    <div id="u377" class="unit available">
        <p>It is not the intention of the new economic space that common interest be purely accidental. The proposal for
            enacting a synthetic commons is that each agent intentionally manages their reciprocal staking portfolio so
            as to secure a proportional reciprocal stake across the network. We term this combination of stake the
            ‘<em>commons asset profile</em>.’ Automated stake trading can find the optimal path for each agent (and all
            agents) to secure their desired holding of the commons asset profile. Some agents will seek a large holding
            of the commons asset profile; others less. The proportion of an agent’s stake held in the commons asset
            profile determines the level of their access to the commons. So individual agents can choose whether to
            enter the commons and the level at which they hold membership. They can change this level by changing their
            reciprocal staking.</p>

                the stakeholder rights to build their own performance in connection with the performance they staked.

            available to the commons. Other performances will be commons-specific, in the sense that they are designed
            so as to be collectively accessible. For example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><em>Data.</em> The network will be ‘spontaneously’ producing a vast quantity of data that will be
                    useful for each agent in order to monitor the health of the network and to inform their own
                    decision-making. Yet each agent owns their own data, so that these aggregate data cannot be compiled
                    and released without mutual agreement. The commons provides the means to co-ordinate and distribute
                    network data. A condition of accessing collective data is that each agent must offer their own data
                    in order to access collective data. Different levels of participation in the commons will be linked
                    to different levels of data exchange and access.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><em>Public goods.</em> There will be some outputs that benefit from scaled access. For some, there
                    will be no exclusion. Agents in the network can access such outputs irrespective of whether they
                    join the commons. But other performances have different attributes, where the possibility of scaling
                    is large but exclusion is required (for example, a concert with a significant but limited audience
                    capacity). These outputs may be offered to the commons. Access to these outputs (and their outcomes)
                    could be conditional upon an agent’s level of commons membership.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><em>Free goods.</em> Some outputs are not produced so as to be sold, but they nonetheless produce
                    value because they meet a recognized need within the network. We know they produce value because
                    agents in the network are staking the performances that generate these outputs.<sup class="footNote"
                        id="fn107">107</sup> These outputs can be attributed a synthetic price (for purposes of data
                    collection), and may be thought of as gifts to members of the commons (see <a

        <p>In summary, the commons is brought into being by reciprocal staking and, once the conditions of a synthetic
            commons has been achieved, agents exchange dividends with the commons. There is no concept of equivalence in
            this exchange, for dividends are distributed directly, without the use of exchange offers. At a collective
            level these dividend offers to the commons constitute a social surplus: that part of network output which
            creates value that is not paid for.<sup class="footNote" id="fn108">108</sup> The commons is a surplus

                <p><em>Underwriting lower-performing stake.</em> The requirement that agents will likely hold (directly
                    or transitively) a proportional stake across the network gives temporary advantage to agents with
                    lower-priced, lower performing stake, for all agents must hold some (small) exposure to these
                    performances in order to hold the commons asset profile. Many of these performances will be in
                    long-term decline, so the commons asset profile gives their stake some support to smooth the price
                    trend. The threshold levels of reciprocal staking that constitute different levels of commons
                    participation will need to be sensitive to this process.</p>

                    commons asset profile. Will it be the absolute level of mutual staking consistent with the commons
                    asset profile, or the percentage of each agent’s stake held in that portfolio? The latter clearly

                    their commons membership). The condition of decay could relate to issues like activity on the

            with the presumed interconnection of capitalist accounting practices with fiat money. In that framing,
            measurement becomes reduced to price expressed in dollars. However, as we discussed in Chapter&nbsp;2 in

            asking how that shared unit came into being, and in whose interest it is sustained. The frequent analogy is
            with centimeters as a unit to measure distance and dollars to measure value. It’s a false analogy. There is
            an international, invariant standard for a centimeter, preserved by the International Bureau for Weights and
            Measures; there is no such basis for a dollar and no one can explain precisely the purchasing power of a US

            is telling: all measures are social conventions, but only some can be adopted as if they are invariant.

                    measuring the rate of exchange at any given time between any two commodities, referred to as
                    exchange value. When unmatched, exchange offers are understood to express views on potential
                    exchange value. The exchange value of any asset can be calculated in terms of any other, but it is
                    convention to use one specific asset to express these offers.<sup class="footNote"

                    we acknowledge its presence from the start, and express all exchange offers with it. This does not
                    require credit, but just divisibility of the assets being exchanged in ‘chunks’ of these units. This
                    unit becomes most visible to the users, when it is utilized to create units of credit which are,

                    the larger the capacity of an agent to exert influence in the network, and express value. This unit

        <p>The Economic Space Protocol challenges the traditional notion that exchanges must involve a money instrument
            in order to be executed. With distributed token issuance, tokens are not a store of value and stake is not
            converted to free-standing tokens when sold. Performance metrics, not just price, determine the network’s
            valuation of an asset. Abstract units of exchange are deployed to increase the matching capacity of an
            exchange offer. These modes of measurement are associated with three distinctive exchange practices of the

                    exchange, where the rates of exchange between any two commodities are translated to these units.
                    Through netting, exchanges can occur without the need to hold and then use a mediating financial
                    instrument (i.e. money). This is of particular importance, since money in a capitalist economy is
                    effectively the ‘right to express exchange value.’</p>

                    issued credit, denominated in units of exchange/units of credit. Agent credit issuance, like agent
                    stake issuance, is determined by the lending/investing parties and is integral to the process of
                    value determination in the network. Staking processes signal the network determination of
                    value-creating performances; credit issuance and settlement through clearing&mdash;and the
                    determination of what performance outputs can be credited&mdash;expresses value in a monetary form.

                <p><em>No interest credit.</em> Credit in the Economic Space Protocol does not generate interest payment

                    and to focus instead on other forms of surplus transfer denominated in different units, and
                    representing different measures of value (see <a href="#Appendix-5.2">Appendix&nbsp;5.2</a>).

        <p>This is a conspicuously different agenda from capitalist ways of measuring. In capitalist economies, the

            of securing a return for their providers at least equal to the rate of profit.<sup class="footNote"

        <p>When we open up the ‘how to measure’ question, the initial task, defined by the International Financial
            Reporting Standards (IFRS Foundation 2015:12), is ‘recognition’: ‘the process of capturing an asset or
            liability for inclusion in the financial statements.’ Capitalism has developed one system of recognition,
            but it is only a convention. In response, we can borrow from Keynes: ‘the . . . conventional method of
            calculation will be compatible with a considerable measure of continuity and stability in our affairs,
            <em>so long as we can rely on the maintenance of the convention</em>’ (1936:152, emphasis in the original).

    </div>
    <div id="u400" class="unit available">
        <p>The unit(s) of recognition of the new economic space are not bound by that convention. We can open up a range
            of different possibilities and build new, flexible conventions. The challenge is to reconcile flexible and
            multiple modes of recognition and measurement with the need for commensuration across the network.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u401" class="unit available">
        <p>We start with the conditions of flexibility, as they apply to each individual performance. The International
            Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS ‘Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting’ (2018:A46–47)) identifies
            a ledger-expressed unit of account (not to be confused with the money function of ‘unit of account’). As
            defined there, a unit of account can be an asset-specific way of measuring and has the following features:

        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>It is selected for an asset or liability when considering how both recognition criteria (see <a

                    to that asset or liability.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>There may be multiple units of account, for example, one for recognition and another for measurement,
                    and the components of the unit of account may change.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>It must faithfully represent the substance of the transaction or other event from which it has

                <p>It is important to consider whether the benefits of the information provided to users of financial
                    statements by selecting that unit of account are likely to justify the costs of providing and using

        <p>The IFRS conditions give the mechanics to measure the distinctive outcomes of each performance’s outputs,
            with careful attention to the differences between performance outputs and outcomes (see <a

    <div id="u402" class="unit available">
        <p>The offer of a performance (see <a href="#4.3-Protocols-of-performances">Chapter&nbsp;4.3</a> and <a
                href="#4.4-Performance-indices-and-value-measures">4.4</a>) must include not just proposed outputs but
            also stated goals of social benefit (outcomes) of the performance, consistent with these IFRS conditions.
            Those outcomes could relate to the social effects of the outputs or of the performance process itself (its
            ‘performing relations,’ environmental footprint, etc.). The challenge is how those achievements are verified
            and validated by the network. This is less a technical exercise of calculation than a social process of
            evaluation.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u403" class="unit available">
        <p>In most conceivable claims to outcomes, an absolute measure may be impossible, for there is no baseline. So
            the objective, as with social impact bonds, is to create a measurable spread between two unmeasurables. In
            the social investment bond described in <a href="#Appendix-4.1">Appendix&nbsp;4.1</a>, the success of a
            policy intervention had no absolute units of measure, but the spread between a control group and an
            intervention group could be measured precisely.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u404" class="unit available">
        <p>How would this framing of a spread play out in the new economic space? It will be an iterative process of
            stake price spreads widening and narrowing. When a performance is offered for staking, the performing agent
            nominates some target outcomes that can be independently verified. Achieving these outcomes is the
            performer’s claim to creating social value. It is the process of staking and the market for stake that will
            verify these claims to value creation.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u405" class="unit available">
        <p>Certain stakers may, after negotiation, make a positive financial evaluation of the potential for that
            performance to create outcomes which will meet the conditions of being declared ‘value.’ Those stakers have
            taken a risk, in anticipation of some form of reward. The rest of the network, which has not acquired stake
            in the performance, may nonetheless be evaluating the performance contract, perhaps changing their stake in
            the agents who have staked the performance. If the performance outcome targets are met, the outputs are
            declared to be value in the network (and validated for clearing credit in the network).</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u406" class="unit available">
        <p>The rest of the network now declares its judgment. When outcome targets are met, the network may judge that
            those targets were in some way inappropriate. They express this by selling off their stake holdings in the
            agents who staked the performance. When the outcome targets of a performance are exceeded, the next circuit
            of performance will <em>probably</em> see higher outcome targets in the performance offer. This is a signal
            to the network that this performance is producing increasing amounts of value, and it will attract new
            stakers: its stake price will increase. Where targets are not met, the next circuit will <em>probably</em>
            need to set lower targets (or performance termination) and stake price will fall.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u407" class="unit available">
        <p>The underlying process is that the network’s evaluation of the attribution of value to the outcomes of a
            performance plays out not attempting to attribute a direct price to those outcomes; it plays out as spreads
            on stake prices. Here we see an important reason not to collapse network information simply to stake price,
            for it can disguise the social meanings transmitted in the network, of which price is just one. ‘Lying
            behind’ the shifting staking prices are the simultaneous determination of what constitutes value and how
            claims to value creation are verified. Here, we see rich network data&mdash;economic media&mdash;as the
            bearer of the process of value expression.</p>

        <p>An implicit assumption to date has been that markets are liquid. It is a widespread assumption in economics
            and has enabled all sorts of theories to simply ignore or marginalize the question of illiquidity,
            especially at the level of individual agent relations. It is a misleading assumption. Agents face what Perry
            Mehrling (2011), following Hyman Minsky, calls ‘the survival constraint.’ Expressed simply, ‘[i]f you can’t
            roll your funding as it comes due, you are dead.’ This constraint goes to the heart of exchange, and we see
            it manifesting everywhere as businesses going broke and people losing their homes due to illiquidity.<sup
                class="footNote" id="fn120">120</sup> Yet for Hayek, market participants agree to a price but there is
            no bid-ask spread;<sup class="footNote" id="fn121">121</sup> for Marx, commodities are assumed to exchange
            at their value, and illiquidity is framed as a source of crisis, not as an integral variable of exchange.
            Indeed, in Chapter&nbsp;3, where we first introduced our categories of exchange, we explicitly assumed
            market liquidity for the simple reason that liquidity is a system-wide issue: it can only be understood in
            the context of the flows of the overall network, and that’s not the place to start an analysis.<sup
                class="footNote" id="fn122">122</sup></p>
    </div>
    <div id="u415" class="unit available">
        <p>We know liquidity to be contingent on the social relations that secure ongoing capacity in market processes,
            and those social relations are themselves unstable. An economy based on staking performances is always
            opening a time interval between the performance offer and recovery of costs of mounting a performance, or
            the time taken for the completion of a ‘circuit of performance’ (to use a term adopted in <a
                href="#11.2-The-performance-circuit">Chapter&nbsp;11.2</a>).<sup class="footNote" id="fn123">123</sup>
            Volatility and liquidity are tied together. These issues can now be addressed, although further layers of
            understanding will also be added in later chapters.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u416" class="unit available">
        <p>The key to liquidity is access to credit. Credit is an IOU. In the Economic Space Protocol, credit gives an
            agent the right to amend the network ledger&mdash;to match an offer and issue a token&mdash;when that token
            is, in effect, provided by another agent. But to frame credit as just a personal relationship between two
            agents would miss its significance in the network, for the issuance of these IOUs also connects directly to
            issues of securing network liquidity. In the absence of centrally-issued money, and the associated
            capacities of a central bank to regulate liquidity, distributed issuance of credit performs money-like
            functions that must create and sustain liquidity. In this chapter we address the issuance of IOUs and the
            conditions of their settlement (credit clearing).</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u417" class="unit available">
        <p>A second role of credit for liquidity is the network’s requirement of credit to enable exchanges that can not
            be performed without granting a delay in their payment. We will consider this second role in <a
                href="#9.3-Netting-and-clearing">Chapter&nbsp;9.3</a>. It is important to address at the outset of a
            consideration of credit a widespread popular perception that debt (the flip-side of credit) involves the
            social and financial subordination of borrowers to lenders. It is a relationship predicated on extraction.
            We share that view. Our focus on credit rather than debt is not semantic. Credit is about connecting the
            present to the future and no economy can work without credit. It secures network liquidity and brings
            forward the capacities of agents to create that future. Debt re-expresses credit by reference to the
            attached obligations; invariably with a focus on interest payments. But in the new economic space there is
            no role for interest payments and no incentive for any agent to agree to pay interest on credit. One of the
            expressions of distributed issuance of credit is that it brings to the attention of every agent the
            contingency of liquidity and their own capacity to alleviate illiquidity. It is in their own interest to
            issue credit; it doesn’t need the payment of interest.</p>

        <p>As an agent-to-agent relationship (more precisely, an agent-to-network-to-agent relationship), distributed
            issuance has come up in earlier chapters. In itself, it is a straightforward process. All agents have the
            capacity to offer and/or accept credit to/from other agents. This means that each agent is not just a
            producer, participating in performances, and an investor, staking other agents’ performances, but also a

        <p>We understand that some readers will immediately be skeptical about the idea of agents being banks, for they

            idea that all agents can be banks is rhetorical when we think of banks as institutions, but the idea that
            all agents can be issuers as well as receivers and clearers of credit is entirely serious. Indeed this is at

    <div id="u427" class="unit available">
        <p>The capacity to issue credit has already been prefigured as a network logic, but without being named as
            credit. The model of stake issuance introduced in <a
                href="#5.2-The-circular-logic-of-reciprocal-staking">Chapter&nbsp;5.2</a> is implicitly a
            credit-issuance logic.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u428" class="unit available">
        <p>A basic credit-issuance logic, standard in financial economics, is that a bank issues dollar credit of its
            own <em>private</em> creation. The dollars it issues are used by the borrower to make payments to others,
            who deposit their received money in their own bank, which may be different from the borrower’s bank. The
            private issuance is now accepted by the depositor’s bank; indeed that bank will not know the direct source
            of the money it has taken on deposit. There has simply been the acceptance/absorption of the newly created
            money: it has been declared to be money. The privately-issued money is now part of the banking
            <em>system</em> and thereby validated as <em>social</em> money.<sup class="footNote" id="fn126">126</sup>
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="u429" class="unit available">
        <p>Similarly in relation to stake in the Economic Space Protocol. An agent in the new economic space creates
            stake by <em>privately</em> investing in other agents and receiving investment from other agents. These
            investments now appear to the <em>network</em> as an agent holding a portfolio of stake, which is taken
            <em>socially</em> as collateral for credit. The issuance of stake involves stake ownership rights being
            declared as an asset. It is essentially the same logic as banking. By analogy, when each agent in the
            network not only undertakes performances but acquires stake in other agents’ performances, and uses that
            stake as collateral for credit issuance, each agent is a producer, an investor and also a bank.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u430" class="unit available">
        <p>Once the network can bring a portfolio of stake into existence, analytically it is straightforward to count
            that stake as collateral, declared in the network’s unit of exchange. Stake then becomes collateral for a
            line of credit issued in that same unit of exchange, now simply renamed a unit of credit.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u431" class="unit available">
        <p>Several propositions follow from this simple connection:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><em>All credit can be fully collateralized.</em> Lenders can nominate their required level of
                    collateral, so individual agents will be operating with banking capacities akin to those of shadow
                    banks.<sup class="footNote" id="fn127">127</sup> This adds stability to the lending (minimizing
                    default risk), and the costs of any default will be borne across the network.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><em>Credit has a material basis.</em> The claims attached to stake ownership give a material basis to
                    credit.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><em>Expanding stake expands credit.</em> There is an ongoing incentive for agents who are developing
                    a performance to issue stake on that performance, and to buy stake in others, for the more stake
                    they acquire, the greater their capacity to secure credit.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div id="u432" class="unit available">
        <p>The proposition embedded here is that the value of stake-as-collateral can be priced and verified across the
            network. Each agent is therefore aware that the path to their own liquidity is to issue liquidity to others.
            This is not merely an ethical exercise of mutual support, though it will embrace that. The point is that, in
            the design of the Economic Space Protocol, there are no disincentives to any agent issuing collateralized
            credit when the network faces illiquidity, and hence no grounds for interest payments.</p>

    </div>
    <div id="u434" class="unit available">
        <p>When the network adopts a capacity for credit issuance, credit itself becomes the liquid expression of the
            unit of exchange and the key to the verification of value within the network. Credit is the means to express
            all value in the network in the same units. The process here is critical to understanding the new economic
            space and the proposition that a network that has no central issuance of money (no conventional ‘money’) can
            nonetheless have network-wide credit at its core.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u435" class="unit available">
        <p>A simple proposition is the key. All stake is different, but all credit is of the same kind. We first explain
            the proposition before clarifying how it is key.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u436" class="unit available">
        <p>Each unit of stake is a holding in a different performance, undertaken by a different agent. The differences
            between each stake are important, for acquiring a range of stakes gives an agent the diversity of risk
            exposures in their stake portfolio. In aggregate, the linked diversity of reciprocal staking gives the
            network a common investment in a network future: there is unification via risk sharing (‘risking together’).
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="u437" class="unit available">
        <p>But credit is all of the same kind, and its fungibility is integral to its role. It is denominated in the
            network’s unit of exchange (hence the unit of exchange is also the unit of credit) and it can be used
            throughout the network: credit is not tied to the particular performances that formed the collateral of
            credit. In simple terms, the IOUs of credit can be used for transactions across the network and can be
            repaid across the network. Put slightly differently, within a network of credit, where agents are both
            borrowers and lenders, no agent can know which particular chain of credit they link to,<sup class="footNote"
                id="fn128">128</sup> so there is a logical demand for a common unit in which to express credit (Doepke
            and Schneider 2013).</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u438" class="unit available">
        <p>It follows that liquidity arises not through exchange (‘monetized barter’) but through commensuration across
            a network, and its form of expression is in credit.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u439" class="unit available">
        <p>What, then, is the significance of the identification that all stake is different and credit is universal?
            Here we have to ‘loop back’ and recall that staking is the way in which agents in the network express their
            relative views on what performances contribute to network value (<a
                href="#5.2-The-circular-logic-of-reciprocal-staking">Chapter&nbsp;5.2</a>). The incentive in staking is
            to invest in the performances that you believe make the greatest contribution of aggregate, network value.
            The outcome of the aggregate of these staking decisions is the collective determination of that network
            value. The dialectical relationship between the choice of staking and the value of stake is integral.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u440" class="unit available">
        <p>At the point of the analysis where this valuation process was initially described, it could only be expressed
            in relative terms, as staking ratios. But credit and liquidity open the path for these ratios to be
            expressed in the unit of exchange; as prices, and given the appearance of absolute measures.<sup

    </div>
    <div id="u441" class="unit available">
        <p>The simplest way to see this is in the question of what pays down credit, or how an agent works off an IOU.
            An agent who uses credit to create and offer a performance to the network is, in ‘normal’ circumstances,
            creating outputs that get verified by the network as the creation of value via the attribution of a price,
            in processes already explored (<a href="#4.2-Performing-relations">Chapter&nbsp;4.2</a>). This created value
            can be used to clear credit, no differently from the way income is used to repay a bank loan.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u442" class="unit available">
        <p>Here is the critical development. So long as the network has endorsed an output as value (and given a price
            in one of the four ways described in <a href="#3.5-Ways-of-pricing">Chapter&nbsp;3.5</a>), the agent who
            granted the credit is not concerned about what particular outputs are produced to repay their credit, for it
            shows on their ledger simply in the network’s unit of exchange/unit of credit. Nonetheless, ‘behind the
            scenes,’ clearing credit will often involve not just two but multiple agents across the network. Even though
            credit establishes a value exchange flow, by linking two agents, value exchange will flow across multiple
            links.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u443" class="unit available">
        <p>This is the same process by which output produced for the commons can be attributed value on the network
            ledger: when it is executed through a credit process, the (network-endorsed) value which is given away can
            nonetheless appear on a ledger as a positive value when it is part of clearing credit, for it is
            automatically converted to the network unit of exchange.</p>

        <p>While a single exchange may be the simplest of economic acts, generalized monetary exchange requires the most

            the absence of an active central authority (state). We now see that credit and stake form an intertemporal
            double helix. Stake binds the network by generating unity out of diversity (portfolio theory); credit binds
            the network by giving value coherence to diverse performance outputs (unit of exchange, expressing a theory

    <div id="u449" class="unit available">
        <p>Most economic theories built ‘from the ground up’ start with exchange. Hayek’s theory is pure exchange, where
            money is just the assumed medium. Marx began <em>Capital</em> with simple exchange&mdash;linen for
            coats&mdash;so as to ‘discover’ that they have abstract labor in common as their point of comparison (and
            equivalence). The populist history of economics starts with an allegory that once there was barter and then
            the limitation of the ‘double coincidence of wants’ led to the ‘invention’ of money as a means of exchange.
            This depiction is misleading for in many contexts credit/debt is the precondition of trade, but analytically
            it suggests that economic relations start with specific/unique outputs and only later ‘invent’ or logically
            derive the generality of money.<sup class="footNote" id="fn131">131</sup></p>
    </div>
    <div id="u450" class="unit available">
        <p>Money does not come into being as a means of exchange but as credit. That embeds money deeply in social
            relations, for while trade occurs in a moment of time, credit is a relationship over time, and those
            relations cannot be assumed stable, either in themselves or in their economic context.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u451" class="unit available">
        <p>Of all the leading economic thinkers of the past, it is most conspicuously Keynes (and later Minsky) who
            gives focus to the conditions of money. Keynes supposedly ‘solves’ the problem of money and volatility via
            state policy, where a state monetary authority is the <em>deus ex machina</em> of the ‘laissez faire’
            economy, providing the economy with a money instrument, secure banking for credit issuance, and the
            stabilization capacities of a central bank. For obvious reasons, it is not a ‘solution’ we care to adopt; in
            part because it turned out to be no solution at all.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u452" class="unit available">
        <p>Nonetheless, the fact that Keynes was analyzing the nature of money at a critical turning point in its
            history&mdash;the end of the 19th century gold standard&mdash;resonates with the current period. His
            proposal in the 1930s was that the state must ‘back’ money; called ‘chartalist money.’<sup class="footNote"
                id="fn132">132</sup> A century on, with the capacities of cryptotokens, that necessity for the state is
            being challenged. But the core questions Keynes posed are broadly consistent with what we face in
            contemporary cryptoeconomics.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u453" class="unit available">
        <p>In his 1930 <em>Treatise on Money</em>, Keynes contended that clearance comes not simply via price agreement
            between buyers and sellers, but via credit.</p>
        <blockquote class='internalQuote'>
            <p>Money comes into existence along with Debts, which are contracts for deferred payment, and Price-Lists,

    <div id="u454" class="unit available">
        <p>With distributed and mutual token issuance, a token, denominated in the unit of exchange, does not exist
            prior to the offer (i.e. the opening of a process of exchange). An offer of a token in return for a
            commodity (be it a good, service or another financial asset) is itself the creation of money: first as
            available credit (the offer) which is matched (the mediation or ‘medium’ in the exchange) and validated and
            settled through the verifiable exchange of commodity-backed tokens.</p>

        <p>Keynes gave significance to this time interval in a way that Hayek could not. His focus was to account for
            the way agents deal with uncertainty, and the way the state manages potential illiquidity (and crisis)
            implied by uncertainty. This is of central importance also in a distributed cryptoeconomy, and we can follow
            Keynes’ approach. In 1933 he wrote an important essay called <em>A Monetary Theory of Production</em>:</p>
        <blockquote class='internalQuote'>
            <p>The distinction which is normally made between a barter economy and a monetary economy depends upon the
                employment of money as a convenient means of effecting exchanges&mdash;as an instrument of great
                convenience, but transitory and neutral in its effect. . . That, however, is not the distinction which I
                have in mind when I say that we lack a monetary theory of production. An economy, which uses money but
                uses it merely as a neutral link between transactions in real things and real assets and does not allow
                it to enter into motives or decisions, might be called&mdash;for want of a better name&mdash;a real
                exchange economy The theory which I desiderate would deal, in contradistinction to this, with an economy
                in which money plays a part of its own and affects motives and decisions and is, in short, one of the
                operative factors in the situation, so that the course of events cannot be predicted, either in the long
                period or in the short, without a knowledge of the behaviour of money between the first state and the
                last. And it is this which we ought to mean when we speak of a monetary economy. (1933, pp.408–9)</p>

            place.’ The analytical point is the individual who comes to market. The Economic Space Protocol recognizes
            these rights and adds additional foundational layers of rights compared with those attributed to a
            ‘citizen.’<sup class="footNote" id="fn135">135</sup> However, when analysis starts with a single agent,
            interactions across agents in a network can often go unacknowledged. Our focus on economic space gives that
            acknowledgement: the context is not a ‘market<em>place</em>,’ but a ’market<em>space’</em> or exchange
            network. These shared (distributed network) protocols frame the formalized rights and the responsibilities
            of agents and become the foundations upon which contractual relations can be created.</p>

    <div id="u461" class="unit available">
        <p>These relations all have expression in protocol accounting operations. There will need to be many such
            operations and hence many network conventions built. Our objective is not an exhaustive coverage of these
            requirements, but to reference illustrations of the style of these protocol requirements and show how
            protocol design transitions from conceptual proposals about the nature of markets, tokens and prices to
            formal ledger-based practices. The issues we have chosen to illustrate are those that were core to our
            initial reframing of markets in Chapter&nbsp;3: the processes of offer issuance, matching, netting and
            clearing. This and the following chapter are expositions of those processes.</p>

        <p>Exchange between any two (or more) parties can be framed as an exchange of rights and expressed on a balance
            sheet as a transfer of assets and liabilities. This framing is what Perry Mehrling calls ‘the money view’ of
            exchange, for it records, as a bank does, assets and liabilities rather than income and expenditure
            accounts.<sup class="footNote" id="fn136">136</sup> So the recording of a simple good or service sale sees
            the seller gain an asset in the form of a token and the loss of an asset (a commodity) of equal value. The
            buyer has a reciprocal movement&mdash;the acquisition of the commodity and the liability of a payment of a
            token. The formal expression of Mehrling’s money view is consistent with the requirements of protocol
            design.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u464" class="unit available">
        <p>An offer is a statement of the rights an agent is willing to give and the rights they are seeking to receive
            from <em>any</em> other agent in the network. Reciprocal issuance is the realization of an offer as a formal
            agreement between two or more <em>specific</em> agents. This would make no sense prior to the development of
            distributed network applications, for there would be no credible basis for trust in distributed issuance.
            But a network ledger and exchange protocol provides a basis for verification: protocols, in a contractual
            form of rights on one side and duty or obligation on the other, can enable agents to have confidence that
            making offers and their matching, recorded on a ledger, will replace the role currently performed by the
            state’s money and central and private banks.</p>

        <p>When an exchange occurs in a network, whether it be for commodities or stake, we depict traders as making
            offers to either exchange commodities/stake for credits (buy), or credit for commodities/stake (sell). But
            this is not the conventional simple exchange of the economic textbook, and in two critical ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><em>The whole network is involved</em>. Exchange is not between two autonomous agents, but between
                    each agent and the network. This is more than a statement that the seller may not know or meet the
                    buyer. It is that the process of offer-matching, netting and clearing requires the whole network of
                    participants (and its full set of protocols) on the other side of the contract.<sup class="footNote"
                        id="fn137">137</sup> The need for this complexity is integral to scalability and liquidity<sup

                    Protocol from many p2p systems that require direct matching or personal relations to secure trust in
                    the process.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><em>The time interval of exchange is critical.</em> In the conventional economy, money ‘solves’ the
                    time interval because it stands in for the other commodity: a commodity can be exchanged for money
                    and money later converted to another commodity. In the equivalent process in the Economic Space
                    Protocol, an offer must be matched with an acceptance by another agent. There may be a direct match
                    on offer but, if not, the network must find a coordinated set of matches, and matching may require a
                    temporary issuance of network credit to ‘buy time’ in order to generate a match.</p>

    <div id="u466" class="unit available">
        <p>Tokens are transferable and quantifiable bundles of rights, whose ownership gets recorded through a ledger.
            Tokens themselves hold no mystery: they are simply a representational device that point to ‘real’ assets. As
            these transfers are specific, so the tokens that represent them are specific,<sup class="footNote"
                id="fn139">139</sup> and as the transfers are between two agents, mediated by the network, so tokens can
            only be issued by agents (not centrally). It follows that tokens have a corresponding right&mdash;a
            commodity, stake or credit&mdash;that they represent. They are, in essence, (smart) contracts which trigger
            ledger entries.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u467" class="unit available">
        <p>The key to token ledgers is that the token and the ‘real’ item move in opposite directions. For example, an
            agent who offers a good or service to the network will receive a token specific to that offer in
            acknowledgment of the offer being matched. More specifically, the act of matching offers validates the
            offered outputs (be it good or service, stake or credit), resulting in the issuance of a token from the
            accepting agent to the offering agent. Note that it is not a promise to deliver an output to a buyer; it is
            a confirmation by the traders that the exchange of rights have been successfully completed.</p>

        <p>In summary, in a network context:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Ledgers record assets and liabilities, not income and expenditure <em>per se</em>. The focus is on
                    changes in stock and the flows that generate those changes.</p>

            <li>
                <p>Credit, we saw in Chapter&nbsp;8, is the key to network liquidity. The network presumes that agents
                    hold lines of credit, for it is through credit that token transfers settle.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>For any agent the object of clearing credit is not to be free of credit, for that would mean free of
                    liquidity, but to open the space for new credit offers. Paying down a line of credit is the
                    equivalent of a payment because it enables an agent to acquire more credit equal to the paydown.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The network discovers the importance of a shared unit of exchange to commensurate credit between
                    different agents. The unit of credit arises from the unit of exchange, as credit’s fungibility makes
                    it the most liquid form of exchange. Functionally, a unit of credit emerges not only to enable
                    relations of exchange, but to enable credit changes that result from exchanges to be cleared.</p>

    </div>
    <div id="u470" class="unit available">
        <p>In the Economic Space Protocol both netting and clearing are a network process, where every agent
            participates and collectively assumes the role commonly taken by a specialized third party like a clearing
            house. This is a distributed exchange protocol, and it enables four levels of exchange:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><em>Exact match.</em> This is where token offers can match one to one. The ask of an offer is the bid
                    of another, and vice versa. It is tokenized barter.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><em>Partial match</em>. This is where the token offers are partially matched, and require several
                    commodity matches to fulfill the offer. This is fractional tokenized barter.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><em>Mediated match</em>. This is when two offers are matched through a third asset, but that asset
                    itself is netted away. In this process, the unit of exchange performs the role of measuring the
                    asset in a way that makes it universally recognized in the network.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><em>Credit mediated match</em>. This is when two offers are matched, through time, and mediated
                    through a credit-giving instrument. In the following chapter, we identify this instrument as the
                    liquidity token.</p>

        </ul>
    </div>
    <div id="u471" class="unit available">
        <p>Exchange mediated through a unit of exchange and recorded on a ledger involves a process of netting: the
            simultaneous exchange of each party’s asks and bids. More complex exchanges, lacking the ‘double coincidence
            of wants,’ require more complex ledger processes, involving an interval of time and a token (credit) that
            can stand for a commodity offer that awaits matching. Here, netting of the ledger is a clearance process.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="u472" class="unit available">
        <p>In conventional markets, this is the function of (central) clearing houses that rely on records of flows
            inward and outward from multiple clients in order to net and clear the market. Where there is an exchange to
            money before conversion to another commodity, credit is being offered to the seller, and there is a clearing
            function.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u473" class="unit available">
        <p>In the Economic Space Protocol, when an agent has different offers but where the unit of exchange is present
            simultaneously in the ask and the bid component, offers may be netted, using the unit of exchange as means
            of computing their exchange rate. Hence, the common asset itself does not need to be ‘owned’ nor exchanged.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="u474" class="unit available">
        <p>As the network scales, there is diminishing likelihood of direct matches in the barter process: ‘blockages’
            become more pervasive and netting starts to require an interval of time for the ‘discovery’ of a netting
            pathway. To find matches for offers on the network, the protocols of the network will ‘induce’ moments of
            credit to remove ‘blockages’ (illiquidity) in the netting and clearing process. This is an additional role
            of credit in the network to that identified in the previous chapter. The time interval implicitly requires
            the creation of credit, which can be retracted when the match is found. It is the oil that lubricates the
            netting process: it temporarily ‘stands in’ for different sorts of commodities (or stakes) in the
            facilitation of the netting process. As the network scales, and the ‘blockages’ in direct netting become
            more pervasive, the role of liquidity via credit grows. In the process, the unit of exchange/credit
            consolidates its role as the universal unit of commensuration.</p>

        <p>The processes defined in this chapter are, in effect, the application of concepts developed in
            Chapter&nbsp;3. There, key concepts were being differentiated from conventional framings of markets, prices
            and money. They perhaps appeared simply as asserted redefinitions. By now we can see what those
            redefinitions have enabled: the broad dynamics of the network-as-process that can be expressed on a ledger.
            This is an insight into the sorts of dynamics the Economic Space Protocol must design and enable and the
            ledger-expressed procedure that design expresses. The resulting ‘network awareness’ enables us to reason
            about the economy&mdash;its agents and its artifacts&mdash;as protocols. Awareness also means that protocols
            will be created so as to be redesignable by the network. This ensures that protocol design will remain
            current and fit for purpose.</p>
        <p>The following chapter takes this identification further, to look at the exchange of commodities stake and

        <p>In conventional markets, derivatives are understood as tools of risk management, delineated as futures,
            options and swaps. They involve ownership of attributes of an underlying asset, but no necessary ownership
            of that asset itself. Those attributes are generally related to price spreads, but could in principle apply
            to any index constructed to describe the underlier.<sup class="footNote" id="fn140">140</sup></p>
    </div>
    <div id="u479" class="unit available">
        <p>To frame reciprocally-issued tokens as derivatives opens up three related issues.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><em>Exposure to the future.</em> They are both statements about the future, and the formation of
                    possibilities. Token issuance is about their potential to be validated (backed) by a network, so
                    they embody an exposure to the future of that network.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><em>Quantified social relations</em>. In an economy based in issuance, redemption and settlement, the
                    token immediately implies a quantified social relation. Tokens represent what we call ‘network
                    derivatives.’ This depiction signals that token types give a partial ‘exposure’ to the total social
                    relations: we are ‘decomposing the social’ via different token categories, in a way that cannot be
                    done by a singular, centrally issued coin.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><em>Attributes of assets.</em> Derivatives imply classification or bundling. Each oil option
                    contract, for example, is distinctive in its detail (they have different prices because they are
                    written on different prices of oil, have different expiry dates and different strike prices). But
                    they have a recognized common (formulaic) relation to oil such that they are priced relative to each
                    other, giving future oil a set of continuous prices. Similarly, each individually-issued token must
                    be recognisably a ‘member’ of a type, so each token within a network must be recognisable as a
                    version of the tokens issued by others.</p>

        </ul>
    </div>
    <div id="u480" class="unit available">
        <p>In summary, tokens are mutually recognized exposures to the output value that defines the network. This is
            the sense in which they are derivatives. Each token’s strike price is determined by the network’s expression
            of the value of a bundle of output values which is deemed to back a token.</p>

        <p>Our analysis is now in the domain of ledgers and tokens. We need to present the relations of exchange, credit

        <p>Stake involves asset ownership capacities of participation in performances and exposure to dividends (yields)
            on performances. Reciprocal staking is a two-way economic communication interface, through which credit,
            commodities or other stake can be distributed throughout the network. As a process, reciprocal staking binds
            the network in on-going common interest. Stake tokens, issued to represent the transferred ownership of

        <p>In a distributed economy the offer-as-line-of-credit is the starting point and reciprocal token issuance is
            its appearance.<sup class="footNote" id="fn144">144</sup> In exchange, when the offer is published, it
            becomes a line of credit, whether it be in the form of commodity credit (an offer to deliver output in the
            future) or financial credit (an offer of liquidity). Hence the offer stands as an option on credit proper.
            The right to exercise the option&mdash;to draw down on the line of credit by accepting the offer of
            credit&mdash;is itself a form of liquidity. In summary, the offer is liquidity, and the matching of that
            offer brings the liquidity token into being.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u493" class="unit available">
        <p>The incentive to issue liquidity tokens is the recognition that scaling transactions and complex networks
            will not work without intertemporal smoothing. This frames liquidity token offers as a social act of

        <p>The Economic Space Protocol implements a ‘network credit agreement’ (with stake as collateral). A credit
            agreement is an automated ‘topping up’ of credit: when any credit is cleared by an act of exchange of
            liquidity tokens, the line of credit is topped up to its agreed limit. This ensures that credit offers are a
            constantly-adjusting stock, enabling credit itself to manifest as a flow. Credit tokens bear no interest or
            yield; nor are they an effective store of value.<sup class="footNote" id="fn145">145</sup></p>

                    passive numeraire mediating the valuation of other tokens: it becomes <em>a unit of distributed

        <p>In effect, the commodity token is designed to represent informational events that include, but are not
            limited to, the delivery of actual goods and service. In a single commodity exchange, price is just one data
            event, with the potential statistical significance of other data events awaiting discovery within the
            network. In a dynamic system of exchange, commodity transactions will be tied to credit issuance. A
            commodity token, verifying the creation of commodity value, can be utilized to settle credit. Credit tokens
            and commodity tokens will therefore often be paired in clearing a ledger entry.</p>

        <p>Each agent will be an issuer of its own commodity tokens and each commodity token offer attaches to a
            specific commodity output. The acceptance of the offer of a commodity, declared by issuance of a token in
            payment, means that every commodity has a matching token. Accordingly, the total of commodity tokens issued
            in a time period is equal to the total commodity exchange for that period. This is true for each individual
            agent and for the network as a total. When we separate the data into new commodities and re-circulated
            commodities, commodity token issuance can be used as a one proxy measure of a ‘fundamental value’ in the

        <p>Two simple points, among many, can be drawn from Figure 10.4. First, commodity tokens can be used for the
            acquisition of stake or other commodities, or they can be used to clear credit. The latter is the closest to
            a commodity token being thought of as ‘money.’ The network validation of an output does not generate cash,
            but the clearing of credit. Second, exogenous money (fiat or cryptocoins) can enter and leave the network as
            commodities. This means that fiat can be used indirectly for the purchase of stake or commodities or the
            clearing of credit, and commodity outputs can be conveyed to fiat. The exchange rate will be determined by
            offers on the network, and this will regulate the incentives to move assets between fiat and the Economic
            Space Protocol unit of exchange.</p>

        <p>Figures 10.2 to 10.13 show sequences of token exchanges across token categories (commodity for credit, for
            example) as well as within token categories (for example commodity for commodity). We see in these diagrams
            that each token type plays a different role in the flow of assets in the network. Each token type holds,
            encoded in its programming as a financial instrument (i.e. a smart contract), certain rights that are
            distinct. Each token type serves a different purpose. In summary:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><em>Stake tokens are shares of an economic agent’s output.</em> They give the user the capacity to
                    receive dividends through their application programming interface (API). It is an expression of
                    accumulated ownership. Its ledger entry records a stock, and the attached exposure to the risks of
                    growth and contraction in the value of that stock.<sup class="footNote" id="fn148">148</sup>
                    Furthermore, stake tokens serve as communication pipes, utilized for agents’ economic peering.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><em>Liquidity tokens grant the right to clear</em>. This right can be verified through their AIP. If
                    a clearance is successful, a liquidity token with any remainder is returned. It is an exposure to
                    future potential states, but without carrying the risks of those states (except for default). It
                    involves the advancement (and writing down) of credit to meet the immediate liquidity requirements
                    of the network, both those between agents to maintain their accumulation and the matching and
                    netting requirements of achieving settlement in exchange.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><em>Commodity tokens are an exposure to an offer for an agreed output.</em> They are the most
                    programmable token type, and can hold any interaction logic and carry any given rights. It comes
                    into being only at the completion of a match, as verification of ‘what already is.’ This enables it
                    to connect to measures of fundamental value as a ‘real abstraction.’</p>

        <p>The Economic Space Protocol is styled to give precision to the roles of different tokens, but there is a need
            to show how these token types, and the economic processes they express, relate together in the social
            process of ‘value in movement.’<sup class="footNote" id="fn149">149</sup> In this chapter we explore the
            economy in the style of a circular flow. This style depicts the economy as a sequence of critical
            inter-connections, located in space time, that combine to secure the conditions for the reproduction of the
            flow. A circular flow should not depict the protocol as a closed system (there can be interaction with
            capitalist markets at any point). Nor should the flow be presumed automatic. Any break in the flow is a
            possible interruption to the system, but they should be presumed and incorporated.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u511" class="unit available">
        <p>Nonetheless, the definition of a sustainable network is that it has the capacity to generate its own
            conditions of reproduction. Put simply, if the network requires continuous injections of outside money in
            order to reproduce (after an initial bootstrapping phase as described in <a
                href="#Appendix-1.2">Appendix&nbsp;1.2</a>), it cannot have aspirations of being a protocol on which to
            build a postcapitalist economy. Yet that should not gainsay the expectation that outside money <em>will</em>
            enter the network; but it will do so as a commodity, not as ‘money,’ and it will be to expand the network,
            not reproduce it.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u512" class="unit available">
        <p>Framing an economy as a circular flow has a long history in economics, starting most prominently from
            François Quesnay’s <em>Tableau Économique</em> (1758), through Marx’s circuits of capital in Volume II of
            <em>Capital</em> (1885) (explicitly connected by Marx to Quesnay), Luxemburg’s <em>Accumulation of
                Capital</em> (1913), Sraffa’s <em>Production of Commodities by Means of Commodities</em> (1960),
            Leontiev’s input-output model (1966) and interpretations of Keynesian multiplier effects (sometimes said to
            have been derived from Marx). None of these depictions could be called a ‘formal model,’ at least not in the
            current sense in which that term is applied, but they are designed to be quantifiable (in a way that so much
            current discussion of the ‘circular economy’ is not). Our exposition here is conceived in that long
            tradition and offers a heuristic device to show patterns of inter-connectedness (and possible disconnection)
            in the economy.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u513" class="unit available">
        <p>We take our mode of exposition from Marx’s (1885, Part I) depiction of circuits of capital. For Marx, these
            components of the circuit are money capital, commodity capital and industrial capital. All can be thought of
            as essential elements of a self-reproducing system, but they are also three ways of looking at an overall
            circular process that involves all of money, industry and commodities.<sup class="footNote"

    <div id="u514" class="unit available">
        <p>In our depiction, the stages of the circular flow are: performance (Pe), collateral (Co) and credit (Cr). All
            circuits require each of these components. As a circuit, there is no original starting or end point, but
            when we describe the circuit by starting an explanation from each different point, and look at the way in
            which the circuit reproduces that nominated starting point, different issues of emphasis become prominent.

            <li>

        <h5>11.2 The performance circuit: the circuit of value creation</h5>
    </div>
    <div id="u518" class="unit available">
        <p>The start and end point of this circuit focuses on production and consumption as a pairing, for combined they
            depict the performance of value creation in the network.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u519" class="unit available">
        <p>A performance starts with an offer by an agent to the network to produce outputs it believes will be valued
            by the network. The offer is also seeking staking from other agents who may directly participate or take
            some financial interest in realizing the performance. Through staking, performances become (underlying)
            assets which is the key to their standing as collateral (Pe–Co).</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u520" class="unit available">
        <p>The act of staking highlights that the offer of a performance is a risk position on the future: an estimation
            of whether the performance being staked will receive future social recognition (replication, adoption or
            some other form of socially recognized approval). This risk position is played out over time: whether a
            performance does, indeed, create the value its implementers intended and its stakers aspired to. The direct
            expression of the playing out of risk is the changing price of stake, as the network monitors the enactment
            of a performance.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u521" class="unit available">
        <p>When stake is used as collateral for credit issuance (Co–Cr), a change in the value of a performance, and
            hence of stake, means that the value of collateral will change over time. In particular, there is a risk
            that a performance whose staked value falls will see a fall in the value of collateral, and hence shift the
            risks of default to the issuer of credit. There will be clear incentives for collateral to be based on a
            pooling of staked performances. This is the momentum of ‘risking together.’</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u522" class="unit available">
        <p>Hence, when credit is used to fund the acquisition of inputs for the agent’s next performance (be it
            repeating the same performance or innovating a new one) (Cr–Pe), it is apparent that the playing out of
            risks of the previous circuit impacts on the capacity of this agent to mobilize future credit. The signal of
            that risk evaluation is stake price. Stake framed as collateral now becomes the backing for the offer of a
            line of credit (Co–Cr), so the change in the value of a performance impacts the future provision of credit
            to fund the construction of future performances (Cr–Pe).</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u523" class="unit available">
        <p>When framed as the circuit of an individual performance, we see emphasis on risks and changing network
            valuation of performances. When framed as the circuit of the total of network performances, we see how the
            growth of network-created value leads to the funding of new performances. Hence we depict Pe–Pe as the
            circuit of value creation.<sup class="footNote" id="fn151">151</sup></p>

    </div>
    <div id="u525" class="unit available">
        <p>The start and end point of this circuit focuses on the propensity of the network to expand wealth. Wealth in
            the network is expressed in stake price growth, for staking, and hence stake price, responds to where new
            value is being created. But our analysis of a circuit&mdash;a flow&mdash;should not be centered on the stock
            dimension. This is why we focus on stake-as-collateral rather than stake-as-wealth.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u526" class="unit available">
        <p>Collateral is stake, qualified by risk, and measured by the unit of exchange. Stake exists as a (diversified)
            portfolio of unique, differentiated assets. When looked at as collateral, the focus shifts from the
            diversity of performance-backed stakes to the singularity of an abstracted unit of measure, expressed in the
            unit of exchange/unit of credit. Portfolio valuation is a critical analytical shift, for it opens up the
            calculative basis for decisions ‘rebalancing’ portfolio holdings as risks change. The intentional shift of
            agents’ stake holdings is the key to shifting the growth and direction of the network.<sup class="footNote"
                id="fn152">152</sup></p>
    </div>
    <div id="u527" class="unit available">
        <p>In summary, collateral is the conversion of a diverse range of stakeholdings into a single index of
            valuation, and from here it can be expressed in the same terms as credit (Co–Cr): from the perspective of
            the portfolio it is the unit of exchange; from the perspective of credit, it is the unit of credit. But it
            is the same unit.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u528" class="unit available">
        <p>Credit backed by collateral then appears as a trusted (risk-rated) source of liquidity, which will be
            advanced to individual agents to fund specific performances (Cr–Pe). In the previous link (Co–Cr), what was
            a process of converting diversity to sameness now becomes the opportunity for creating diversity out of
            sameness (Cr–Pe). This pulse from diversity to singularity to diversity drives the growth of the network.
            The question the circuit resolves is whether the performances that backed collateral at the ‘start’ of the
            circuit will be the same as the performances that get funded by the credit raised from the staking of those
            performances.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u529" class="unit available">
        <p>In this role, collateral is the means to make risk commensurable across the network so that different
            performances and their risk/return calculations can be expressed in a common unit of measure. The movement
            from Pe–Co, which completes the circuit, has expressed a view about which performances will thrive and which
            will not.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u530" class="unit available">
        <p>The Co–Co circuit expresses the risk-adjusted measure of <em>growth of accumulation</em> by the network

        <h5>11.4 The credit circuit: the circuit of stability</h5>
    </div>
    <div id="u532" class="unit available">
        <p>The start and end point of this circuit focuses on the provision of liquidity and the propensity of the
            network to be stable (whilst it grows). Its starting point is individual offers of liquidity to enable the
            network’s new value creation (production and consumption). An agent draws on credit to fund the design,
            build and stake a future performance (Cr–Pe). The provision of credit avoids illiquidity which would
            otherwise impede the creation of (stakeable) performances. From the perspective of the credit circuit, the
            movement Cr–Pe expresses the decision about <em>which</em> performances will be staked: which performances
            are most likely to succeed, and hence repay the credit from the value of their outputs.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u533" class="unit available">
        <p>The movement Pe–Co reveals that the risks of the creditor and staker are different. The staker’s risk is
            reflected in their dividend deriving from the value of the performance. It is the <em>growth</em> position.
            The creditor’s risk is simply that the performance generates enough return on stake to give the issuer of
            stake tokens sufficient revenue to repay credit. This is both a lower level of risk so credit will more
            likely be directed towards ‘safer’ investments: riskier investments will likely rely more on stake than on
            credit. This is the sense in which the credit circuit emphasizes the capacity of the system for stability.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="u534" class="unit available">
        <p>When the circuit is completed by collateral as the backing for credit (Co–Cr), it is now apparent that the
            more successful stakes are the ones that ‘survive’ to form future collateral, and especially collateral that
            will not decline in value over the life of the circuit. This selection process establishes a stable basis on
            which further performances can be chosen and funded.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u535" class="unit available">
        <p>When framed as the circuit of an individual line of credit, the circuit shows the processes by which the
            conditions for its repayment are created (and the risks that are ’passed through the circuit). When framed
            as the circuit of total credit we see how credit is being directed to those performances most likely to meet
            risk/return calculus. The credit circuit, therefore signals not just the stability of the circuit, but the
            stability of the connection over time between performances and value.</p>

        <p>The circuits described above are a heuristic device: they are not inputs into a model or input/output
            analysis of the new economic space. The objective is to show that a single transaction, posed as a movement
            in a circuit, takes on different meaning according to how the circuit is being described. This is more than
            a statement that, to invoke Gunnar Myrdal, all points of view are views from a point (although that is
            important). It is that these different meanings form a spread of meaning, and therein lies fertile grounds
            for volatility in the system. But it is not a volatility to be eradicated as a threat; indeed it is the
            lifeblood of the network. Without volatility, the system would stagnate.</p>

        <h5>12.1 Stability</h5>
    </div>
    <div id="u540" class="unit available">
        <p>In a distributed protocol, claims to stability cannot relate to conventional macroeconomic indicators like
            unemployment and GDP growth, nor to counter-cyclical policy measures. Those agendas are tasked to states:
            their taxing and expenditure policies and their monetary regulation capacities. Instead, claims to stability
            must be about the relationship between tokens and the material underliers of the network. To claim
            more&mdash;for example, to maintain stability with respect to the US dollar or to US economic
            growth&mdash;is not just a claim that, in practice, cannot be sustained (at least not without making this
            the sole purpose of a token); it is an aspiration we do not hold. A different economy, with a different set
            of goals and processes, is intended to diverge from the US economy; not to track its performance. This
            relates to our proposal that participants in the new economic space, who nonetheless remain heavily exposed
            to capitalist economies, will be ‘living in the spread’ (<a
                href="#1.6-The-immediate-proposal">Chapter&nbsp;1.6</a>). The centrality of tokens in the Economic Space
            Protocol relates to token value stability and the capacity of tokens to facilitate economic processes in
            ways that tie token issuance to ‘real’ value and the capacity of credit issuance to the smooth operation of
            the network.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u541" class="unit available">
        <p>We have the opportunity to rethink what we mean by stability. An economy may be stable in its own terms: its
            average return on capital, unemployment rate and exchange rate may be stable (we once could have included
            inflation rate and interest rates here; but no longer), but it may be unstable by other criteria such as
            poverty levels, life expectancy, access to health care, housing affordability or carbon emissions. When
            targeted metrics of a postcapitalist economy are different from those of a capitalist economy, each economy
            will likely appear as volatile, if not failing, when measured by the metrics of the other. We believe that
            the most robust claims of ‘stability’ cannot rest on attachment to another entity itself deemed ‘stable,’
            without becoming a mere replica of that other entity. Stability must be a statement about self; not others.
            The claims to stability of the new economy are threefold:</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u542" class="unit available">
        <p>The unit of exchange/unit of credit stabilizes as the economy scales. This means the network is trusting the
            relationship between the credit and the network’s system of output valuation: in effect, new value created
            in the network is an accepted means to clear credit in the network.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u543" class="unit available">
        <p>Stake prices change in an orderly way. This means that stake price reflects ‘fundamental value’ and the
            economy is producing the output it claims to produce.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u544" class="unit available">
        <p>Volatility inside the network is a statement about the relationship between stake prices and the unit of
            exchange. This gives a measure of stability/volatility of ‘real’ network change over time and applies to
            both the volatility of individual stake prices and the total value of stake in the network.</p>

    <div id="u546" class="unit available">
        <p>A further issue of stability comes when we consider the impact of outside money within the network.<sup
                class="footNote" id="fn153">153</sup> There is nothing stopping agents exchanging in dollars, just as
            they can use any object&mdash;a bag of barley or a coat&mdash;as a particular unit of exchange. But these
            will have to convert to other units for recognition across the network.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u547" class="unit available">
        <p>It has been mentioned (e.g. <a href="#10.5-Exchanges-between-tokens">Chapter&nbsp;10.5</a>) that dollars can
            enter the network, but they do so as commodities, not as token substitutes. Entering as a commodity means
            that something must be ‘given up’ (offers of commodities or stake expressed in terms of the network unit of
            exchange) to acquire dollars. Nonetheless, a commodity entry of dollars does create an implicit exchange
            rate between the protocol unit of exchange and the dollar, for commodities and stake can be priced in
            either. Nonetheless, the entry of dollars and the creation of an exchange rate has significance. First, the
            exchange rate will impact where agents source commodities and how they fund stake, indicating that there are
            no clear boundaries to the network. This is the money/token dimension of living in the spread. Second, the
            exchange rate between the unit of exchange of the Economic Space Protocol and the dollar will likely be
            volatile. This doesn’t challenge the stability of the unit of exchange within the new economy’s token
            system; indeed, over time, the question will be whether it is the network’s unit of exchange or the dollar
            which is to be described as ‘volatile.’ In that optimistic statement lies the expression of the political
            battle for legitimacy of the new economic space.</p>

        <h5>12.3 Volatility</h5>
    </div>
    <div id="u549" class="unit available">
        <p>With stability defined by reference to the value of outputs in the new economic space (see <a
                href="#Appendix-12.2">Appendix&nbsp;12.2</a>), there is no juxtaposition of stability and volatility.
            The goal is not to reduce volatility in the name of stability, but to recognize that volatility is integral
            to financial markets and to risk. The goal is to direct volatility and see that it occurs in parts of the
            system where there is ‘intentional’ indeterminacy; where it expresses flexibility, discovery and the
            estimation of risk and of value. Agents creating performances, purchasing stake, and changing their minds
            about which performances are value-creating, will generate welcome volatility as the pulse of the new
            economy. Each of these can be thought of as financial spreads, in which agents take positions.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u550" class="unit available">
        <p>So volatility can be both essential to dynamism and itself convey valuable information. We know that in
            conventional capital markets, the development and trading of real-time volatility indices is seen as a
            critical market indicator. Inside a volatile market there are standard strategies for hedging to neutralize
            volatility (‘delta hedging’) and, moreover, to profit from trading volatility itself, stripped of
            directionality (Lee, 2020).</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u551" class="unit available">
        <p>We are not seeking to initiate the development of volatility-trading markets in the Economic Space Protocol
            (though nor do we hold a view as to the likelihood or merits of their development). The emergence of DeFi
            opens significant potential for these markets. Yet for all the potential of DeFi, it is currently just
            replicating the calculus of mainstream finance. While adding flexibility and capacity to agents, it also has
            potential of leveraging instability for its own sake.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u552" class="unit available">
        <p>There are (as yet) no techniques for modeling current volatility in crypto markets. Any suggestion that DeFi
            can offer a cryptoeconomy financial tools to accurately measure (and hence delta hedge) volatility should be
            treated skeptically. Volatility is an expression not just of inefficiency of estimation but of social
            dynamics expressed in financial channels. Managing the channels does not itself stabilize social dynamics:
            it causes volatility to displace into other modes of expression. So for the Economic Space Protocol, there
            is no intention to control volatility with the goal of restricting it, but to direct it to sites where it
            can be embraced (as potential). Accordingly, volatility has two central roles.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u553" class="unit available">
        <p>First, the information generated in markets has to be interrogated for patterns that can be given economic
            meanings as ‘performances’: offers of data analytics. Volatility here will be associated with the issuance
            of stake in those performances. But such performances carry risks, there can be no certainty about which
            performance designs will generate information which is valued by the network.<sup class="footNote"
                id="fn154">154</sup> For any particular performance, this source of volatility can be expected to
            diminish as the performance becomes statistically consolidated; with new performances continually being
            configured, the domain of the issuance of stake itself remains an on-going site of volatility.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u554" class="unit available">
        <p>Secondly, the value of staked positions will change constantly as agents change their views about what
            performances are successful (valuable). This will be a domain of continual volatility, for volatility is the
            condition of liquidity in the market for stakes.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u555" class="unit available">
        <p>It will be apparent that, in practice, the two volatilities will not be discrete: the first will embed
            expectations about the second, and the second will reflect levels of confidence in the first. The network
            has capacity to trace which economic events are associated with which stake price changes. This can be
            thought of as feedback loops on performance staking, vetting the values of past performance designs and
            giving incentives for agents to design more precise/granular performances.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u556" class="unit available">
        <p>These stability-generating loops offer no guarantees of the network being long-run stable in its outcomes on
            the terms we have nominated. We should not overstate the capacity for creating stable outcomes. History
            shows that guarantees of stable systems only come with authoritarian control, and then only for as long as
            resistance can be suppressed.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u557" class="unit available">
        <p>Currently, nation states, for all their regulatory and legal enforcement capacities, are struggling to secure
            even modest economic stability. For those states, policies for stabilization must be reconciled with a
            politics of whose interests have been served by the instability, whose interests must be protected in any
            stabilization process, and hence who is going to absorb the costs of stabilization policies. Moreover, this
            playing out of deep conflicts has to all be wrapped in a policy discourse of economic necessity and common
            interest, while in fact being neither of those.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u558" class="unit available">
        <p>We are not engaging in this same process. Although we describe the network as a commitment to a collective
            future, especially through reciprocal staking and the mechanisms of distributed credit, there is no
            suggestion that this is the playing out of a single, agreed vision. Protocols are about processes, not
            realizing a pre-given agenda. Our goal is that in creating the conditions for a collective future, divided
            aspirations have transparent expression and network conflicts have mechanisms to be played out in an orderly
            way; not hidden behind the idea that a centralized authority knows and implements the common good.</p>

    <div id="u560" class="unit available">
        <p>Marx drew the distinction between the simple form of value (the exchange of commodities) and the general form
            of value (growth, or the accumulation of capital). Keynes drew a roughly similar distinction between a ‘real
            exchange economy’ (monetized barter) and a ‘monetary economy’ (which includes time, credit, liquidity and
            therefore risk) (see <a href="#Appendix-8.1">Appendix&nbsp;8.1</a>). How do we describe tokens in the
            expanded accumulation of a ‘monetary economy’?</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u561" class="unit available">
        <p>Each performance is itself (in combination with other performances) eventually revealed in the creation of
            commodities.<sup class="footNote" id="fn155">155</sup> It could be a ‘conventional’ commodity (good or
            service) but performances have been framed in the Economic Space Protocol to engage also data commodities,
            or what we have called economic media. This focus represents what is distinctive about commodities in the
            21st century compared with the eras of both Marx and Keynes: the rise to prominence of intangible outputs
            whose value-as-commodity is so difficult to specify (see <a href="#Appendix-5.1">Appendix&nbsp;5.1</a>).</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u562" class="unit available">
        <p>In order to gain analytical access to data commodities, we have brought stake (and its projections of a
            contingent future of the performance) to the center of the analysis. The proposition is that the outputs of
            performances themselves may be difficult to define and measure, but that every proposed output should be
            measured by its intended outcomes, and that these can be expressed in measurable ways. But the stark,
            consequential expression of output evaluation is the preparedness to stake the process of their creation,
            and this can be clearly measured in a market process. Perhaps, it might be said, shifting from commodities
            being exchanged (Marx, Keynes) to performances being staked, and referring to this as the ‘simple’ form of
            value, is stretching the word ‘simple.’ But, we believe, this is necessary as a way of recognising the
            prominence of information in commodity-money relations.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u563" class="unit available">
        <p>The expanded form of value in our analysis is qualitatively different from what we depict as the simple form,
            and the critical difference remains centered on the role of information. In this expanded version,
            information is not just the means by which individual agents make decisions about the future (what to
            stake). It is also the means by which the collective of agents (the network) reaches its determination of
            what constitutes value. For both Marx and Keynes, the rule of profit is central to delineating what parts of
            the economy grow via a cycle of profit and investment, and what parts shrink. For them, what constitutes
            ‘value’ is a resolved parameter, defined by the protocols that constitute capitalist accumulation. But in
            the new economic space, without a predetermined measure of ‘value,’ expansion becomes a more fluid process,
            for when agents stake performances, they not only project its creative success on a two dimensional scale
            (how profitable it will be) but now also on a third dimension (what will be judged socially to be valuable).
            In this framing, reading trends (information) is the universal key to explaining the dynamics of value.</p>

    <div id="u565" class="unit available">
        <p>The claim that the new economic space is grounded in fundamental value has been made on multiple occasions.
            It is perhaps a contentious one, predominantly because the concept itself is contentious.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u566" class="unit available">
        <p>Many economists balk at the concept of ‘fundamental value.’ Some do so because they believe that current
            price in the market is a sufficient measure of ‘value’ and any idea that value is something ‘deeper’ than
            price, as the classical economists believe, is simply metaphysics. Hayek and the neo-classical economists
            are disposed to this view. Others, in the tradition of Keynes, (also) reject fundamental value specifically
            as it relates to asset prices. Asset prices, they say, incorporate guesses about the future expressed in the
            present and, as no-one can know the future, asset prices now are just expressions of popular opinion about
            the future (see <a href="#Appendix-5.1">Appendix&nbsp;5.1</a>).</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u567" class="unit available">
        <p>The Economic Space Protocol generates a direct connection between tokens and their material foundations in
            the ‘real’ economy. This foundation is what we mean by fundamental value: it implies a mode of valuing that
            looks to ‘deeper’ determinants (underliers) and discounts for speculation and short-term price movements. A
            clear connection between tokens and their underliers is itself a claim to a critical form of stability
            within the network.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u568" class="unit available">
        <p>In cryptoeconomics, there emerged significant engagement with the concept of fundamental value, including via
            options pricing theory and the efficient markets hypothesis. We have made contributions to this debate in
            the past (e.g. Bryan 2018). Much analysis involves application of the old (originally 18th century;
            attributed to philosopher David Hume) ‘equation of exchange,’ often expressed as the ‘quantity theory of
            money.’ The Economic Space Protocol can give a version of a quantity theory as a way of verifying the direct
            connection of tokens to underliers at both the level of individual transactions and the level of the network
            overall.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u569" class="unit available">
        <p>The formula of the old Quantity Theory of Money states: MV=PQ. Where:</p>
        <br>
        <span class="displayFont">M</span> = the quantity of money in circulation, <br>

        <span class="displayFont">V</span> = its velocity of circulation of money, <br>

        <span class="displayFont">P</span> = the general price level in the economy and <br>

        <span class="displayFont">Q</span> = the quantity of goods and services sold in the economy.

        <br>
    </div>
    <div id="u570" class="unit available">
        <p>The cryptoeconomics discussion of this issue has been innovative and creative, albeit that interest in it
            appears to have fallen away in the past few years, despite the growing popularity of terms like ‘creator
            economy’ and ‘ownership economy’ which suggest the generation of measurable value.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u571" class="unit available">
        <p>Taking MV=PQ into a crypto setting has required each of the variables be significantly adapted. Tokens are
            not simply ‘M,’ and hence V must change meaning (velocity of what?). In the Economic Space Protocol, ‘P’ is
            not a mono-measure of the terms of exchange and hence Q cannot be adequately expressed in relation to P.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u572" class="unit available">
        <p>A token only comes into existence when an offer is matched (and expressed through the creation of a debit and
            a credit record on corresponding ledgers). As an aggregate, we can compile a list of offers. Thus an offer
            expresses the potential creation (supply) of a token. An exchange offer between a good or service (Q), and a
            token instrument (M), where Q units are in the bid and M units are in the ask, denotes the exchange ratio
            relationship between Q and M, that can be interpreted as the price (P) of a Q unit, in terms of M. V is the
            speed at which M is issued and cleared; an issue of liquidity considered Chapter&nbsp;9.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u573" class="unit available">
        <p>M represents the number of token units required to fulfill that exchange (Potential M). Since M is revolving,
            meaning it flows in both directions (as it is both ‘earned’ and ‘spent’) we can say that V is the average
            speed at which M flows in both directions in a given period of time. V then constitutes a multiplier where a
            net revolving amount of M, is required to fulfill all offers of Q at price P. Thus M x V = ∑(PM × Q) (per
            period of time used to calculate V).</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u574" class="unit available">
        <p>Where Q1P1 can be matched with Q2P2, netting represents an instant exchange, or it could be said that the M
            component can be netted away. The distributed market processes of offers and matching, closed by a netting
            process, gives a literal interpretation/verification of MV=PQ. Because every token offer (potential M) must
            be matched by a ‘commodity’ (PQ) in order to become ‘actual’ M, then M and PQ are ‘2 sides of the same token
            offer.’ And in this context, with every match the M that is specific to it expires. New M comes into being
            with a new offer validated by its matching. In effect, the velocity of a token is infinite, so M tends
            towards 0: that is, the settlement of an exchange is at once the expiry of M. There is money flow, but no
            money <em>supply</em> required: M can be deemed to have been simultaneously issued and redeemed. So MV=PQ is
            definitionaly true, albeit not quite as an identity (as it is in the quantity theory of money), but as a
            protocol design.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u575" class="unit available">
        <p>The above depiction, making a clear and direct connection of tokens to output, is contingent upon a direct
            offer matching and complete netting. The introduction of a time interval (credit) and the possibility that
            matching may be indirect, or mediated through a web of matchings, requires a deeper explanation.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u576" class="unit available">
        <p>Netting is not itself an explanation of fundamental value when trades occur at different times and there is
            not a one-to-one correspondence between offers. Put simply, netting presupposes the existence of the things
            to be netted, yet their delivery to market will not be simultaneous with the offer. Temporal gaps open a
            need for credit to provide liquidity to the time interval. Hence fundamental value must be explained in the
            context of credit and the need to create liquidity across a time interval. In this context, credit itself
            has fundamental value: delivery on its promise of future exchangeability.</p>

            POSTCAPITALIST ECONOMY</h2>

        <h5>13.1 Introduction</h5>
    </div>
    <div id="u579" class="unit available">
        <p>The Economic Space Protocol proposes an economy of distributed relations, without reliance on a central 3rd
            party authority. This is not a proposition that current nation states are redundant, for there are many
            centralized facets of society, and the rule of law is a conspicuous one, which impact directly on the
            economy. The new economy will exist in any foreseeable future within a mainstream social and economic
            context. It is simply presenting an alternative economic way of being and doing, and it offers a protocol
            that can be readily adopted by anyone, without the sponsorship of any nation-state.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u580" class="unit available">
        <p>How the new economy interfaces with the conventional economy is an open design space, but also a domain of
            uncertainty. The specific objective of our analysis is to present the case, and it can be no more than a
            case, that, after an initial bootstrapping phase, the Economic Space Protocol offers a set of economic
            relations that can be self-reproducing. There will be porous boundaries between the conventional economy and
            the new economy: fiat money, commodities and people will move between the two systems. Indeed it is likely
            that every single user will have a foot in each system. But it is critical that we can present an economic
            logic for a coherent alternative that can become independent of constant financial top-up from outside (for
            example in dollars). A design goal is that the new economy can produce a surplus that generates its own
            conditions of continuation and expansion.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u581" class="unit available">
        <p>Self-sustainability in a narrow economic sense is important, but it would be a modest achievement if the
            alternative we are proposing looks pretty much the same as the existing system. The new economic space we
            are proposing offers a new vision of economic relations: the conditions of increasing equality of living
            standards, the creation of environmental health, and an economy sensitive to the aesthetic, cultural, and
            emotional attachments of participants. These are the collectively-determined, socially-defined conceptions
            of calculable value creation, or what we can term simply ‘network value.’</p>
    </div>
    </div>

    <div id="13.2-Network-value">
    <div id="u582" class="unit sticky available">
        <h5>13.2 Network value
        </h5>
    </div>
    <div id="u583" class="unit available">
        <p>The contention throughout this analysis is the capacity of the new economic space to incorporate performances
            creating outputs motivated by network value, and the capacity of the network to reward the performances that
            animate network value creation. We need to make as clear as possible the connection between network value,
            rewards and system reproduction. It requires all elements of the Economic Space Protocol, and all the
            earlier chapters to be brought together.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u584" class="unit available">
        <p>Performances motivated by network value are already familiar: philanthropy, crowdfunding, etc. are all
            expressions of this agenda. The challenge is to show the conditions under which network value is sustained
            and reproduced without the need for continual injections of outside money. In other words, the social
            surplus recognized in network value needs to be seen as equivalent to profit in capitalism: where the market
            evaluates and rewards performances with a yield of some form recognized by the network, either through
            individual agents or the commons.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u585" class="unit available">
        <p>Outputs being ‘recognized by the network’ is the term we use rather than ‘selling for a profit,’ for many
            performances may not generate profit; indeed are not targeting that objective. But they are targeting
            <em>some</em> objective: we are not compiling the conditions where just any old performance might expect
            reward.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u586" class="unit available">
        <p>The ‘yield,’ if not profit, must be in a form acceptable to the network: it could be commodities, credit,
            stake or indeed any kind of governance or access rights. The condition of the network being capable of
            self-reproducing is that the yield takes a form that the network can use for its reproduction: the yield is,
            or can be converted to, the inputs required to open another circuit of accumulation. This capacity to form a
            circuit is critical to the difference from philanthropy, which requires on-going injections of outside money
            for a new circuit to commence.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u587" class="unit available">
        <p>The question remains: how does the network systematically recognize the values that animate performances,
            such that those values are recognized and reproduced by the circuit of accumulation? Here, the issue of
            staking is pivotal. The market-based determination of which performances agents are willing to stake is the
            network’s way of declaring what sorts of outputs (and the notions of value they embed) the network is
            backing financially. If we assume that staking is undertaken for reward, as described above, it must be the
            case that the ways outputs get recognized by the network provide the conditions of reproduction of the
            circuit, including the remuneration of stake.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u588" class="unit available">
        <p>However, this is not a sufficient framing to complete the argument, for it is posed only in terms of the
            conditions of reproduction of individual stakes and individual outputs and their outcomes; not the network
            as a whole. The additional dimension relevant here is that stake is the collateral for credit, and credit is
            paid down out of both commodity token exchanges and rewards for performances. With a focus on the conditions
            of issuance and repayment of credit, the analysis takes the general form, expressed now in the network’s
            unit of credit. The ultimate test of the network’s embrace of network value, and outputs produced in
            accordance with that value calculus, is whether a commodity token, received in return for the provision of a
            particular commodity output, will be accepted by (all agents in) the network for purposes of clearing
            credit. Its acceptance is network verification; its denial is the opposite.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u589" class="unit available">
        <p>Acceptance will not be a sudden and arbitrary determination at the moment of offer, as the above depiction
            may seem to suggest. Information flows in the network, taking the form of performances (for data must be
            encoded with meaning), will be providing agents in the network with real-time information on how offers are
            being evaluated and matched. So, working backwards from the acceptance of a commodity token in paying down
            credit, we can identify the social logic that leads to its likelihood of acceptance: the commodity token
            must relate to a commodity deemed valuable, which must come from a performance deemed value-creating, which
            is funded by stake deemed by a critical number of staking agents to be an investment in value creation and
            deemed by the network as providing collateral worthy of credit issuance.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u590" class="unit available">
        <p>This is the general process by which the Economic Space Protocol supports and sustains an economy of network
            value. In the new economy, everything depends on everything else, as it does in a capitalist economy or any
            economic system. The taxonomies and measures, the systems of valuation and rewards and the pulses that keep
            the system moving are all mutually defining. It cannot be otherwise. At the core of the Economic Space
            Protocol is a simple proposition: in a distributed economy, everything depends on the generation and
            processing of agent-generated information, and the way that information is compiled, evaluated and acted on
            must also be agent-centered. So the Economic Space Protocol is a case for agent-centered internal
            credibility and coherence, and the condition of entry is the desire to experiment.</p>
    </div>
    </div>

    <div id="13.3-Where-to-from-here">
    <div id="u591" class="unit sticky available">
        <h5>13.3 Where to
            from here?</h5>
    </div>
    <div id="u592" class="unit available">
        <p>The protocol design principles of the new economic space have required that we cover some detailed and
            diverse conceptual and philosophical issues and combine them with the capacities of programmable protocol
            design. There are, no doubt, other ways to imagine and initiate a transition to postcapitalism, and we
            welcome that debate.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u593" class="unit available">
        <p>The proposal presented here makes the case that the conditions of postcapitalism lie latent within capitalism
            and, to make that latent potential imminent, we must develop ways to engage capitalism at its contemporary
            frontier of innovation; to go beyond, rather than to turn back. In particular, we need to engage three
            related elements.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u594" class="unit available">
        <p>First is the emergence of a digital economy, which provides the technology to build that digital future, even
            though it is also integral to many of the incapacities of current capitalism to meet many social needs
            (notably well-paying ‘jobs’);</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u595" class="unit available">
        <p>Second is the risks that people are currently experiencing in their individual and collective lives: most
            obviously the risks of individual financial precarity on the one hand, and environmental destruction on the
            other. We are not trying to eliminate risk: we want to initiate social and economic relations where people
            can choose to risk in the creation of new things, to do so in creative, cooperative ways, and to have those
            creations valued socially. This will include, but is not restricted to, risking to innovate to address
            issues of inequality and environmental destruction.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u596" class="unit available">
        <p>Third is the rise to economic and social dominance of a culture of financial calculation. Individually, this
            is expressed as the need for debt to acquire housing or gain education or, for too many, to undertake daily
            subsistence. This rise is integral to the current acceleration of a wide range of inequalities and
            poverties. Currently, this culture is expressed in the rise of banking and insurance as a site of both
            political power and economic crisis creation, but also a site of extraordinary innovation. We seek to take
            over that innovation.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u597" class="unit available">
        <p>So we have adapted the capacities of post-blockchain technologies for protocol design to create ways for
            people in a network to risk together using financial techniques of staking, derivatives, liquidity,
            volatility, etc.. We are creating an economic media for postcapitalism.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u598" class="unit available">
        <p>This innovation has required that we redesign elements of economic and social language and analysis. For some
            readers, this will have taken them through debates and specifications that felt excessively detailed, and
            perhaps even at points semantic, but we believe that language is important. The old categories always pull
            us back to old ways of posing and answering problems. Our project has seen us, over quite some time,
            imagining future economic possibilities and then having to configure the categories as well as the analysis
            that will bring them coherence. It has, we agree, made for a challenging read. Nonetheless, we are confident
            that, for all this analytical detail, when it comes to being part of the network and living in the
            performances it enables, the operational design can be quite simple.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u599" class="unit available">
        <p>To get to that stage, where people are living at least aspects of their lives in a new economic space, more
            development work will be needed. This document has intentionally left unaddressed how the new economic space
            has a financial bridge to the capital markets, and a full exploration of the ‘outside spread’ that will
            likely drive capital market engagement with the new economic space. These developments await responses to
            the current document.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u600" class="unit available">
        <p>These are complex, but solvable issues. They become solvable not because there is a decisive answer but
            because protocol design embeds indeterminacy, volatility and ambiguity. The question will be whether the
            Economic Space Protocol has embedded them in coherent ways that enable creative adaptation of agent
            practices and of the protocol itself. For now, we present the network as its own internal logic; as a way of
            depicting a viable, evolving, distributed postcapitalism, where participants design their own futures, both
            individually and collectively.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="u601" class="unit available">
        <p>So we now invite feedback, debate and expressions of interest from diverse sources, but especially from
            people and their organizations who can see in this proposal new ways of addressing social problems they have
            always known, or who now sense a potential for change they could not previously have imagined possible.</p>
