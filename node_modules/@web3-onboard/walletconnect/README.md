}

// initialize the module with options
// If version isn't set it will default to V2 - V1 support will be completely removed shortly as it is deprecated
const walletConnect = walletConnectModule(wcV2InitOptions)

// can also initialize with no options...
// Defaults to V2 - V1 support will be completely removed shortly as it is deprecated
// const walletConnect = walletConnectModule()

const onboard = Onboard({
  // ... other Onboard options
  wallets: [
    walletConnect
    //... other wallets
  ]
})

const connectedWallets = await onboard.connectWallet()

// Assuming only wallet connect is connected, index 0
// `instance` will give insight into the WalletConnect info
// such as namespaces, methods, chains, etc per wallet connected
const { instance } = connectedWallets[0]

console.log(connectedWallets)
```
